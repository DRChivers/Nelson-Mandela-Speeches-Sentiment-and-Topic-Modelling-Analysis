In response to His Majesty's call, and in appreciation of his initiative, I would like to assure his majesty of my readiness to meet with Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi with an aim to address all aspects contributing to the current violence. 

We hope that His Majesty's good officers will facilitate the proposed meeting as soon as possible. 

We are convinced that through this initiative and the co-operation of all concerned we can move closer to finding a lasting solution to our country's problems. 

Our people and country yearn for peace which is the main condition for a speedy democratic transformation of our society. 

This initiative by His Majesty, in King Goodwill Zwelithini, is indeed a positive step and must be supported by all who value peace.</body></text></speech>
