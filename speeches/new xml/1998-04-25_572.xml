His Majesty the King, The Mayor of KwaDukuza, Mr Siyanda Mhlongo, 

My brother, uMntwana wakaPhindangene, Inkosi uMangosuthu Buthelezi, 

Ladies and Gentlemen, 

I am truly honoured to celebrate nation-building, freedom, peace and unity with you, as you pay tribute to some of the greatest giants that even walked on our land; Usishaka kashayeki, uNodumehlezi kaMenzi, King Shaka, Mahatma Gandhi and Chief Albert Luthuli. 

This celebration takes place at a most appropriate time as we prepare to mark the fourth anniversary of our freedom. It also takes place at an appropriate place for it was around these hills and valleys that King Shaka shaped his ideas. 

iLembe eleqa amanye amalembe ngokukhalipha had the foresight to understand that there can be no lasting peace without nation-building, freedom and unity. This year we mark the 170th Anniversary of his assassination by his brothers. 

Ngithanda ukubonga ubuhlakani boMkhandlu waseKhaya waKwaDukuza ngokuhlela lomgubho wokujabulela "ukubunjwa kwesizwe saseNingizimu Afrika, inkululeko, ukuthula nobumbano" ngokuhlonipha amaqhawe akithi anjengeZulu, iLembe, uMahatma Gandhi kanye neNkosi uAlbert Luthuli. 

Lomgubho ufike ngesikhathi esihle lapho sigubha impelasonto yenkululeko. Yenzelwe endaweni efanele ngoba kukulamagquma namathafa lapho iLembe leza namacebo okubumba isizwe, inkululeko, uxolo nobumbano. ILembe lalikwazi kamhlophe ukuthi ngeke lwabakhona uxolo uma isizwe singakhiwe, inkululeko ingekho, nobumbano lungekho. Kulonyaka sikhumbula iminyaka eyikhulu namashumi ayisikhombisa selokhu iLembe laphangalala ngesandla sabafowabo. Siyakutusa ukuguqulwa kwegama lalendawo kube iKwaDukuza njengoba Udlungwane lukaNdaba lwaluyazi lendawo. Lokhu akusho ukuthi sesibukela phansi umnikelo owenziwe izinhlanga njengabelungu, amaNdlya namaKhaladi ekuthuthukisweni kwalelidolobha. 

It was also around this region that Mahatma Gandhi spent so much of his time conducting the struggle of the people of South Africa. It was here that he taught that the destiny of the Indian Community was inseparable from that of the oppressed African majority. That is why, amongst other things, Mahatma Gandhi risked his life by organising for the treatment of Chief Bhambatha's injured warriors in 1906. 

This year marks the centenary of the birth of one of the greatest leaders of the freedom struggle: a colossus and yet a foot soldier of our people, Chief Albert Luthuli. His memory will last forever to us who worked with him and followed in his footsteps. This giant chose persecution, including the fact of being deposed as an elected chief by a regime that despised everything African and democratic. In doing so he taught us the lesson that real leaders must be ready to sacrifice all for the freedom of their people. 

It was under the leadership of the Chief that we entered the fighting fifties with the Defiance Campaign, the struggle against Bantu Education, the Freedom Charter, the drawing together of all freedom-loving South Africans across the racial line into the Congress Alliance, the Anti-Pass Campaign by women in 1956, the heightened political ferment in both rural and urban areas and the launch of armed struggle in 1961. 

Kulonyaka sigubha iminyaka eiykhulu selokhu kwazalwa ingwazi uChief Albert Luthuli. Isithombe sika Chief Luthuli siyohlala njalo sikhumbuleka ezingqondweni zethu thina abasebenza naye nababengabalandeli bakhe. Lengwazi eyayihlukunyezwa uhulumeni owawubukela phansi zonke izinto zomuntu omyama ngisho nokumkhipha esikhundleni sokuba inkosi ekhethiwe yesizwe samaKholwa, yasifundisa ukuthi uma ungumholi wangempela kufanele umele noma ibuphi ubunzima ukuze isizwe sikhululeke. 

Sasingaphansi kobuholi buka Luthuli ngeminyaka yo1950 ngesikhathi siqoma ukubhadla emajele kunokuthobela imithetho yobandlululo, silwisa imfundo yengcindezelo, sihlanganisa abantu bezizwe ezehlukene abathanda inkululeko iwesasikubiza ngeCongress Alliance, siqokelela izimfuno zabantu kuFreedom Charter, amakhosikazi elwisa imithetho yamapasi, kukhushulwa izinga lomzabalazo emakhaya nasemadolobheni. Sasingaphansi kuka "Chief" ngesikhathi singena emzabalazweni wezikhali ngo 1961. Sasiboshwe naye uChief ngecala okwakuthiwa elokuketula umbuso ngo 1956. 

When Chief Luthuli demanded: "Let My People Go!", South Africa listened until he became the first person on the African continent to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 

The moving words he spoke on our behalf as a witness in the Rivonia Trial sustained us through the prison years. As he explained our resort to armed struggle in the face of the uncompromising denial of freedom for the majority of South Africans, he evoked the vision of a peaceful, united and just society which sustained our people through the long years of struggle. 

This is what continues to inspire us in the new and even more difficult struggle that we have only just begun, as we roll up our sleeves to achieve a better life for all. 

Your Worship, the Mayor, 

May I congratulate your Council for awarding Chief Albert Luthuli the Freedom of the Town of KwaDukuza posthumously. In doing so you are not only speaking for the people you represent. You are saying what is in the hearts of our whole nation. 

UChief Albert Luthuli waba umuntu wokuqala kuzwekazi lase-Afrika ukuklonyeliswa ngendondo yeNobel Peace Prize ngenxa yobuholi bakhe emzabalazweni wenkululeko noxolo. 

Ngihlala ngibuzwa ukuthi saqiniswa yini idolo sisejele isikhathi eside kangaka. Okusemqoka kulokhu indlela iNkosi uLuthuli asisekela ngayo ngesikhathi sisecaleni laseRivonia nagemuva kokugwetsha ukudilikwlwa ijele. Inkosi uLuthulu yathi: "Ngenxa yokuqinisa amakhanda kwabelungu ngokungafuni ukuhlukana nemigomo enqabela abantu abamnyama kanye nezizwe ezinye ezicindezelwe ilungelo labo lenkululeko, akekho ongagxeka amadoda afuna ubulungiswa ngokuthatha izikhali, Ngeke futhi agxekwe ngokuzama ukugqugquzela umbutho ohlangene ukuze kutholakale ubulungiswa." 

"Ngenxa yalokhu lamadoda asethunyelwe emajele isikhathi eside. Ukuboshwa kwabo kuwukuboshwa kwamathemba okusebenzisana kwezinhlanga ezehlukne. Kuzovela isikhala ebuholini esingagcwaliswa inzondo nokungqubuzana kwezinhlanga. Lamadoda amele ubuqoho emzabalazweni wezombangazwe eNingizimu Afrika. "Llawo mazwi asiqinisa idolo emajele, kumshoshaphansi, ekudingisweni nasentanjeni imbala. Yilawomazwi asiqinisa idolo njengoba sifingqa imikhonto sakha ikusasa elingcono kubantu bakithi bonke. 

Mphathidolobha, 

Ngiyasibonga isinyathelo sokunika uChief Luthuli inkululeko yedolobha kaKwaDukuza nanxa esakhothama. 

Today KwaDukuza has become a place of pilgrimage as it was during the days of King Shaka and Chief Albert Luthuli. As we pay tribute to these giants, let us always remember that there is a difference between showering praises to King Shaka, Mahatma Gandhi and Chief Luthuli on the one hand and to emulate them in action on the other. 

What is it that we as individuals and as communities collectives are doing to promote nation-building, freedom, peace and unity? Would any of these great leaders have tolerated a situation where we still slaughter each other simply because we differ politically? Would they have allowed enemies of nation-building, freedom, peace and unity to divide us on racial lines? They would never have done so, then why should we? 

Let KwaDukuza, the place if iLembe, Mahatma Gandhi, Chief Albert Luthuli and M.B. Yengwa be a place of pilgrimage dedicated to nation-building, freedom, peace and unity. Let it be a fountain of peace and hope. 

Akukona ukulandela ezinyathelweni zeLembe, Mahatma Gandhi no Chief Albert Luthuli ukuthi siqhubeke sibulalane sodwa ngenxa yokungaboni ngeso elilodwa kwezombangazwe. Akukona ukulandela ezinyathelweni zabo ukuvumela izitha sokwakhiwa kwesizwe, inkululeko, uxolo nobumbano. 

Indawo yakwaDukuza okuyindawo yeLembe, Mahatma Gandhi, Chief Albert Luthuli no M.B. Yengwa mayibe umthombo wokwakha isizwe, inkululeko, uxolo nobumbamo! Makube indawo yoxolo nethemba! 

Bayede! 

Wena weNdlovu!
