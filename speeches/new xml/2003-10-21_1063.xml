Dear Albertina 

I would so much have wanted to be here today to celebrate with you and the family. 

Please accept my best wishes on your 85th birthday and sincere apologies for my absence. 

You know better than anybody how much you have been a part of myself over so many years and decades. Absence has, strangely, been a binding element of that relationship. I know that you will know that I am with you in spirit as you celebrate this day. 

You had to spend many birthdays without Xhamela physically at your side. Today, however, is the first one after his final departure from us. I realise how much pain this day must hold for you, too. Together with you, I remember him on this day. The two of you were so much one that we could only look on in admiration and inspiration. 

May the day have its happiness for you as you are surrounded by the children and family; and in the knowledge that the entire country will be celebrating with one of the Grand Ladies of our nation. 

May the years ahead be filled with contentment, happiness, love and good health.
