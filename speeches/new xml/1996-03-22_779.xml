Tuberculosis is an increasing world wide problem and is one of the major health challenges in South Africa. TB has been the scourge of our South African society for too long. All efforts should be mustered to contain and eradicate this disease. 

World TB Day which falls on March 24 each year serves to remind us that the TB epidemic is still out of control in many parts of the world. 

I wish to commend the efforts of the TB Alliance. 

May this commemorative day be an eye opener to every one. 

Nelson Mandela 

President of the Republic of South Africa.
