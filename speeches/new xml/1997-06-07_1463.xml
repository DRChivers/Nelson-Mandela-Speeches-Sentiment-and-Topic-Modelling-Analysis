Lucas Radebe 

Captain Bafana Bafana 

Dear Lucas 

On Sunday, 8 June 1997 Bafana Bafana shall be playing their third international game in 14 days. I am certain that at the end of these two weeks, you shall have won the admiration of many more millions of people across the globe. 

The games against the Netherlands and England were a fine display of football. They were a wonderful advertisement for Bafana Bafana and your country and its people. 

This morning I spent some time evaluating the chances of teams in the different qualifying groups to make it to France in 1998. Your group has been aptly tagged the Group of Death. Aware as I am that you are indeed up against up against quite formidable teams that ate also laying claim to the right to represent Africa in the Finals next year, I am encouraged by the steely resolve your team has displayed thus far. I am convinced that you are fit and deserve a place in the finals. 

I am confident that tomorrow you will do what you are already renowned for, which is to keep the flag of your country aloft and like true warriors, go to battle and conquer. 

We enjoy good relations with Zambia and wish them well on Sunday. I know they will be treated well on and off the field, both by you and the South African public. But the Zambian people also know that there is just so much at stake that years of solidarity must give way, event if for just 90 minutes, to a rivalry the essence of which is an opportunity to parade our skills in the biggest showpiece on earth - the World Cup. 

We shall all be there to cheer you on.
