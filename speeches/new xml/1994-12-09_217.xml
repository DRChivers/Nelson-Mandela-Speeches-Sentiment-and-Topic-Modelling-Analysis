President Nelson Mandela has learnt with sadness of the passing away of Advocate Israel Aaron Maisels. A humanitarian at heart, Advocate Maisels was a courageous opponent of racism and injustice. He was on of the most outstanding lawyers South Africa had ever produced. Yet because of the system of apartheid and the vindictiveness of its captains, his talent could only be fully realised as a Judge outside South Africa - in Botswana, Lesotho and other neighbouring countries. 

We fondly remember Advocate Maisels as an energetic and brilliant lawyer between 1958 and 1961 in the so-called Treason Trial, and as a person of profound knowledge with whom we consulted on a variety of issues, especially after our release from prison in 1990. 

Democrats in South Africa and Southern Africa shall sorely miss this outstanding son of our people. Our nation is the poorer without him. 

Our heart-felt condolences go to his family, relatives and friends. 

Rest in Peace
