President Mandela will meet with General Omar Al Bashir, the President of the Republic of Sudan in Pretoria on Tuesday, 12 August 1997. 

The invitation to President Al Bashir to South Africa takes place against the background of a regional peace initiative under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), chaired by President Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya, which includes President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, President Isias Afewerki of Eritrea and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia. 

At a IGAD meeting held in Nairobi on 8/9 July 1997 the Sudanese Government accepted a Declaration of Principles for further negotiations. 

President Mandela and the South African Government fully support and encourage all parties to the conflict in Sudan to participate constructively in the IGAD initiative. 

President Mandela met with the Chairman of the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Movement (SPLM), Dr John Garang in South Africa during December 1996 and subsequently with the Sudanese Minister of Federal Affairs Dr Ali Mohamed Elhag, who was sent to South Africa as Special Envoy of President Al Bashir. 

Although the SPLM did not participate in the past IGAD meeting held in Nairobi it has previously accepted the Declaration of Principles which would now form the basis for negotiations between the affected parties. 

Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia has recently met with delegations from the conflicting parties and will be sending a Special Envoy to Pretoria for the abovementioned meeting in support of finding an acceptable and lasting solution to the problem.
