Dear Friends, 
We are honoured that you wish to celebrate the birthday of a retired old man who longer has power or influence. 
We wish you well wherever you are serving our country abroad. Please also remember as you celebrate, the work of the three organisations tasked with carrying on our work; they are the Nelson Mandela Foundation, the Nelson Mandela Childrenâ€™s Fund and the Mandela Rhodes Foundation. 
We are all celebrating and we thank you for joining in those celebrations. 
I thank you.
