With reference to various discussions regarding becoming Patron of The Round Square schools, I am very pleased to join Your Majesty and H R H The Duke of York and other Distinguished Patrons. I deeply appreciate your assurance that this will not involve any added burden to my already heavy schedule. This schedule and the responsibilities of government force me to accept this honour on the understanding that I am not able to commit myself to attending formal functions or meetings of the Round Square. Please extend my best wishes to all the young students of the Round Square Schools around the world. 

Yours in friendship and respect,

Nelson Mandela
