She represented so much history in her person and her life, and was for so long the centre of the British Royal Family. With her death an historical era in which many of us shared in different ways has come to pass. 
We found the Queen Mother a warm and caring person, with a keen interest in developments, particularly those in the Commonwealth and the developing world. 
We shall personally cherish our memories of meetings with her. We convey our deepest sympathies to Her Majesty the Queen, the Royal Family and the people of Great Britain.</body></text></speech>
