The donation made possible by our compatriot company De Beers will go some way in alleviating the plight of our children in South Africa who are victims of HIV and AIDS The HIV/AIDS crisis in South Africa, especially in the rural areas is blighting young lives. Children less than 10 years old are forced to head households. They have to feed and clothe their younger siblings; they attend schools infrequently, if at all and they are robbed of their childhood as they carry out the painful tasks of caring for desperately ill parents and relatives. The Nelson Mandela Children's Fund supports the network of community organizations who help these children, with homecare for ailing relatives, food, clothing, and advice and above all with comfort and hope for the future. 

As you know South Africa is the source of some of the Earth's most valued resources - particularly gold and diamonds. But every country of the world has something even important than these treasures - its children. By caring for them now, we are creating a legacy to be remembered well after our own lifetime, a foundation on which they will build their future. 

I wish I could be with you tonight to celebrate the good work of the Jewellers Charity Fund for Children and the significant contribution it makes to the lives of young people around the world. You are legendary for brightening the lives of needy children - through your generous donation this light will also touch some of South Africa's children. 

I thank you</body></text></speech>
