We wish to take this opportunity of conveying our condolences to the government and people of India at the tragic death of Kalpana Chawla in the Columbia space tragedy. 
We have witnessed how the people of her village mourned her death and learnt what a role model she was to young people in India. We trust that even out of her death people will take inspiration to strive for higher things in life. 
Please remain assured, Mister Prime Minister, of our highest esteem.
