The key to controlling TB is to raise awareness about its symptoms and encourage sufferers to seek treatment. It is to ensure that patients follow the full course of medication for the prescribed period. TB patients who are taking their treatment can live and work safely in the community; and they need and deserve our support as they journey towards recovery. 

TB, like other epidemics knows no boundaries. All nations and communities need to join hands to fight the disease. I wish to commend the initiative of individuals and organisations in raising international awareness of Tuberculosis; and in working together to eradicate it.
