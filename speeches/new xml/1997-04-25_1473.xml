Neil Tovey 

Bafana Bafana 

Dear Neil 

The encounter with Zaire on Sunday, 27 April 1997, is obviously the biggest challenge to your illustrious leadership of our football team. 

I am aware of the pressure that is on the team after the contest with Congo two weeks ago. I am pleased to note that the entire team has succeeded in putting that experience behind them. 

27 April 1997 is our National Freedom Day, on which the entire nation will be celebrating our freedom. 

My approach to the game on Sunday is that you will bring glory to our people in the true tradition that Bafana Bafana has come to be known of in the short time we have been part of the international footballing community. 

I assure you of my personal support and that of the entire South African nation. 

Signature NELSON MANDELA
