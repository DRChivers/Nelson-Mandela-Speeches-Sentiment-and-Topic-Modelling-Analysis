On his return President Mandela expressed his extreme concern about the untenable situation on the East Rand. He will visit the violence-torn area tomorrow (at a time to be announced on 5/8/93), and is arranging an urgent meeting with President De Klerk and senior SADF and police generals. 

Nelson Mandela expressed the need for urgent implementation of multi-party control of the security forces, and the establishment of a National Peace Keeping Force without delay. Among matters he would discuss with President De Klerk would be the immediate and effective deployment of the SADF into the area. 

President Mandela emphasised that immediate steps must be taken to prevent further loss of life and property, and that this issue was receiving the highest priority of the ANC leadership and members.</body></text></speech>
