They are convinced that only a total ban on anti-personnel mines can lead to a sustainable solution for this situation. 

A diplomatic conference is at present taking place in Oslo where more than 100 States are negotiating an international convention for a total ban on anti-personnel mines. At an International Conference in Brussels held in June of this year, these States already declared their desire to sign the convention before the end of this year. 

Presidents Mandela and Koller would like to remind the States gathered in Oslo that a historic opportunity is offered to them to take a substantial step towards solving the problems and human suffering which anti-personnel mines cause in many countries around the world. They therefore call upon the States participating in the Oslo Conference to make use of this opportunity and to commit themselves with all determination at these negotiations to a comprehensive prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines as well as to an obligation to clear anti-personnel mines which have been laid and to destroy anti-personnel mines which are stockpiled. 

Presidents Mandela and Koller are aware that even after the successful conclusion of the convention and before all anti-personnel mines have been removed and destroyed these mines will continue to result in human suffering. As a consequence it will be necessary to make even greater efforts in the field of demining and rehabilitation of mine victims in order to alleviate the continuing effects of these mines.</body></text></speech>
