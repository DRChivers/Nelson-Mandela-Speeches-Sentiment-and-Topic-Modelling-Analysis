The meeting was at President Mandela's request, in conformity with the South African government's commitment to promoting human rights and the peaceful resolution of conflicts. Due to the sensitivity of the negotiations that are taking place within the context of recent United Nations initiatives, the President does not wish to make any further comment on this issue. However he hopes that amongst other objectives the recent visit to Indonesia will contribute to finding a solution satisfactory to all role-players.
