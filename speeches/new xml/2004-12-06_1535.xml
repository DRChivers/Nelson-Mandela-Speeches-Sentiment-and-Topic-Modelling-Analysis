As you are undoubtedly aware educating all of our children must be one of our urgent priorities. We all know that education more than anything else improves our chances of leading better lives. As we in Africa face the challenges of building a better Africa, the continued investment in the education of our children must be at the heart of our efforts. No child in Africa and in fact anywhere in the world should be denied education. I know that we can reach this goal by pulling our different strengths and assets through stronger partnerships with government, business and civil society we can make a difference. 

I am launching a worldwide fundraising campaign for schools in Africa, led by the Nelson Mandela Foundation, UNICEF and the Humbag Society for the promotion of democracy and international law. The funds raised will, in the initial phase, support the creation of child friendly schools in South Africa, Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda and Zimbabwe. The schools will focus on improving access specifically for girls, orphans and vulnerable children. 

So much is already being done to improve the life opportunities for children in Africa. This campaign will enhance and strengthen those efforts. Mr. Peter Kramer, Chairman of the Humbag Society, has already made a pledge of 1 million US dollars for the campaign. You can go to this website to make your donation. I call upon you to act now, make a donation and inspire the millions of children of Africa. Fulfil their dreams. 

I thank you.</body></text></speech>
