Dear Professor Nolutshungu, 

I have noted with profound appreciation the decision of the Witwatersrand University Council to confirm your appointment as vice-chancellor of the University. 

The decision marks yet another milestone in the long journey of Wits University to transform itself into a centre of excellence within the context of South Africa's realities and needs. 

As a former student of this great institution, I was highly impressed by the democratic and transparent manner in which the selection process was undertaken. I fully appreciate the strides that Wits has made in pursuit of transformation; and I am confident that you will bring your immense qualities and experience to bear on the efforts of the university in the difficult and yet exciting period ahead. 

My heartfelt congratulations; and I wish both you and the university all the success in your endeavours. 

Yours sincerely, 

Signature Nelson Mandela President Republic of South Africa
