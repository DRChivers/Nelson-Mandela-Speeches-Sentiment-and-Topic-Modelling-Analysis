Congress by definition is an occasion for reflection, rededication and renewal. We trust that this gathering will serve as an opportunity for such rededication and renewal by all. 

We salute you for your tireless and dedicated service to the millions of workers around our country. We urge you not to tire, not to be dismayed when times are tough and to be resilient in these challenging times 

We have made great strides in a relatively short period of fifteen years. The ANC government has laid a firm basis for the realisation of the ideal of free, democratic, non-racial, non-sexist society. 

We salute all for the role they played in the recent general elections. The ANC is the peoples movement. It is firmly rooted in the heart and minds of an overwhelming majority of this country. We must continue to guard, defend and maintain the ANC as a united and democratic movement. 

This congress takes place at a difficult time as the world is engulfed by an economic recession that threatens to derail the achievements of our young democracy. It is at times like these that we need men and women of wisdom to rise to the challenge. We have no doubt that this gathering will meet those expectations... 

Continue being the voice of the voiceless and the conscious of our young democracy. 

I wish this congress successful deliberations.
