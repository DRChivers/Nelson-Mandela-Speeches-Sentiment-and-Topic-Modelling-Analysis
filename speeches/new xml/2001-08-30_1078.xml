It was with a sense of immense loss and sadness that we received the news of the death of Govan Mbeki, one of the great heroes of our struggles. South Africa today mourns the passing of one of Africa's great sons. In the history of our own struggle and of our country his name takes pride of place. We salute a comrade and friend, a leader in struggle, one of the intellectuals of our movement and a fellow member of a generation that has given so much to the shaping of our country. 
We think especially of his wife Epainette, and his sons President Thabo Mbeki and the First Lady, Moeletsi Mbeki and the rest of the family. We convey our heartfelt condolences to them and we mourn with them. We know that they will take courage from the sure knowledge that the entire country shares with them on this day. 
Hamba Kahle, Govan.
