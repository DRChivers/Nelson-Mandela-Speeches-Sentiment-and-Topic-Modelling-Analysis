Dear 
I am inviting a select number of persons to have dinner with me on Thursday 20th March, 1997. 
The Dinner will be held on Robben Island, which as you are no doubt aware, is now administered by the Robben Island Museum. I have had the pleasure of being in the company of some of you at the Historic Reunion of some 1250 ex-political prisoners on Robben Island in February 1995. Your participation in that event contributed largely towards its success. 
I wish to thank those of you who had come to me afterwards, not only to express your concerns about the physical and material plight of some of the ex-political prisoners, but to pledge your continued support. 
The coming dinner on Robben Island provides an excellent opportunity for you to continue what is already and on-going process for the benefit of the most needy ex-prisoners, it is also an opportunity to be ground floor participants in the development of the Robben Island Museum. 
I look forward to seeing you at this gathering, which promises to be unique in more ways than one, and will certainly be most memorable and enjoyable. 
With warm regards 
Yours sincerely signed by: N R Mandela
