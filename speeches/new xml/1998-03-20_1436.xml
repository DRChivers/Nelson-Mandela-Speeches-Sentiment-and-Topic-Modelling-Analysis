Our long bonds of friendship with the people of Ireland and of Britain have made the achievement of lasting peace in Northern Ireland a special concern to us. 
It was therefore with particular happiness that we noted the recent move by the Prime Minister of Britain, the Taoiseach of Ireland and the leaders of political parties in Northern Ireland in their quest for peace. We would like to commend and encourage them in this regard. 
Our interest in progress in the Northern Ireland peace process is shared by peace-loving friends of Ireland all over the world an in many international forums. Ireland has, for example, many friends in the Commonwealth and it is hoped that in due course she will return to the Commonwealth as Fiji, Pakistan and South Africa did.
