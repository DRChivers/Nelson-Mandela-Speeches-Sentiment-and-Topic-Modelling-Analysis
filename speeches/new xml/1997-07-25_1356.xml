My Dear Trustees 
Thank you for coming today to participate in this, our second Annual General Meeting. 
There is no doubt that the Children's Fund has had a good year and is growing from strength to strength. Of particular joy to me is the fact that we are delivering real support to our Grantees where it is most needed - "on the ground". 
Before I hand over to Dikgang our Deputy Chairperson - and I welcome him to his first Annual Meeting in this position - there are two important points I wish to make : 
Firstly I would like to acknowledge how much many of you have done to help Jeremy and his team to carry out our mission and purpose. 
Thank you. 
Secondly in your Papers for later discussion is a Questionnaire on how you might become more involved in the activities of the Children's Fund. 
I do hope you will consider this proposal in the light of the need to sustain our performance into the future. 
The challenge to perform is real and needs all the help we can get. 
So I look forward to your continued support and deeper participation in the year ahead. In this regard the Nominations Committee will be advising me on the appointment of additional Trustees, especially in those provinces in which we are not well represented. 
Thank you again. 
Over to you Dikgang 
Dikgang says : 
1. You have before you the Annual Financial Statements. They have been approved by the Auditors, the Audit Committee and your Management Trustees Committee. 
We, as Trustees now need to "receive and adopt" the Audited Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 1997. 
Are there any questions on the Accounts? 
Can I have a proposer to the resolution please? 
Madiba : "I would like to propose the adoption of the 1997 Financial Statements". 
A Seconder? 
Those for? 
Those against? 
Thank you for adopting these Financial Statements.
