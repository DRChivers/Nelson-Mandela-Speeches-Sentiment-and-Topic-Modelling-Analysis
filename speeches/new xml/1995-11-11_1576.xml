If this is in fact the case, this heinous act by the Nigerian authorities flies in the face of appeals by the world community for a stay of execution. It also puts into question the commitment of the Nigerian military regime to the democratisation of Nigerian society. 

In view of this latest development, the South African delegation at the Commonwealth Conference will recommend the expulsion of Nigeria from the Commonwealth pending the installation of a democratic government. The South African Government will also recommend that similar steps be taken by other international bodies, so as to strengthen the international community's solidarity with the Nigerian people. 

The South African Government is recalling its High Commissioner from Lagos for urgent consultations.</body></text></speech>
