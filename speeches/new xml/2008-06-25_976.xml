It is a great privilege having been able to travel here in our 90th year and be in the presence of so many good friends. 

Thank you for the continuing support in the fight against the terrible scourge of HIV and AIDS. You understand that it is in your hands to make a difference. 

The world remains beset by so much human suffering, poverty and deprivation. It is in your hands to make of our world a better one for all, especially the poor, vulnerable and marginalised. 

We look back at much human progress, but we sadly note so much failing as well. In our time we spoke out on the situation in Palestine and Israel, and that conflict continues unabated. We warned against the invasion of Iraq, and observe the terrible suffering in that country. 

We watch with sadness the continuing tragedy in Darfur. 

Nearer to home we had seen the outbreak of violence against fellow Africans in our own country and the tragic failure of leadership in our neighbouring Zimbabwe. 

It is within this context that we should also see the plight of those affected by HIV and AIDS. 

It is now in the hands of your generations to help rid the world of such suffering. 

I thank you.</body></text></speech>
