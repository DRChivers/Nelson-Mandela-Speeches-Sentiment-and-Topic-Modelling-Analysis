I am glad that the case is over and regret that my ex-wife could not bring herself to negotiate an amicable settlement. It would have saved us both and our children much pain. 

I have instructed my legal representative to negotiate an ex gratia payment to her, and the waiver of the costs granted by the court in my favour. 

I hope and trust that she will now be prepared to be reasonable. It can only be to her benefit.
