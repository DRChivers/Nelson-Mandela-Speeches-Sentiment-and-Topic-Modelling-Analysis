Friends 

I have taken time out of my retirement to make a special appeal to you today. 

As you are undoubtedly aware, educating all of our children must be one of our urgent priorities. 

We all know that, education more than anything else improves our chances of leading better lives. 

As we in Africa face the challenges of building a better Africa, the continued investment in the education of our children must be at the heart of our efforts. 

No child in Africa, and in fact anywhere in the world, should be denied education. I know that we can reach this goal. 

By pooling our different strengths and assets and through strong partnerships with government, business and civil society, we can make a difference. 

I am launching a worldwide fundraising Campaign for Schools in Africa led by the Nelson Mandela Foundation, UNICEF and the Hamburg Society for the Promotion of Democracy and International Law. 

The funds raised will, in the initial phase, support the creation of Child Friendly Schools in South Africa, Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda and Zimbabwe. The schools will focus on improving access specifically for girls, orphans and vulnerable children. 

So much is already being done to improve the life opportunities for children in Africa. This campaign will enhance and strengthen those efforts. 

Mr. Peter Kraemer, Chairman of the Hamburg Society has already made a pledge of U$1million for this campaign. 

You can go to this website, www.schoolsforafrica.com to make your donation. 

I call upon you to act now. Make a donation and inspire the millions of children in Africa to fulfil their dreams. 

I thank you</body></text></speech>
