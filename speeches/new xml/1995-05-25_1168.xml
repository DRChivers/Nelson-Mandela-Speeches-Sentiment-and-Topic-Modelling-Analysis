Sir Ewart Bell; 
Guests of Honour; 
Players and supporters; 
For the next 30 days, youth from the world’s leading rugby nations will be displaying the finesse of a sport that provides entertainment and touches the hearts of hundreds of millions across the globe. 
Your presence in South Africa affirms the unity in diversity, and the humanity in healthy contest, that our young democracy has come to symbolise. 
On behalf of our rainbow nation, I welcome you all. We extend our hands across the miles to all rugby lovers who will be among us in spirit during this exciting period. 
South Africa keenly appreciates your love and support. And we are grateful for the International Rugby Board’s decision to hold this tournament here. It adds impetus to our own sports development programmes and, indeed, to our nation-building effort. 
From the first kick-off, we are certain to witness rugby of an exceptional standard. Through it, we shall also contribute to the promotion of excellence, world peace and friendship. 
South Africa opens its arms and its heart to embrace you all. 
It is my privilege to declare this, the 1995 Rugby World Cup Tournament open.
