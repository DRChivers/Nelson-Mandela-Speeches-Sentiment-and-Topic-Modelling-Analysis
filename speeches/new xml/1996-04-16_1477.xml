Her Majesty will know from her recent visit to South Africa, the warmth in the hearts of all our people towards the her; towards the people of Britain; and the Commonwealth of Nations. 
History has given our two countries a long and complex relationship. It had its share of difficulties, but the joint efforts of our peoples in pursuit of freedom has made the antagonisms a thing of the past and laid a basis of hope for the future. 
We appreciate in particular Her Majesty's role in helping build the Commonwealth into an association which stands for principles which affirm the rights and equality of people everywhere. 
I look forward eagerly to visiting Britain later this year, as an opportunity to lend still greater strength to the bonds that are growing between our countries and our peoples. 
We wish Her Majesty a happy birthday and good health.
