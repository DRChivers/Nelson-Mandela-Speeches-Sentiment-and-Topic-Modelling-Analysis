Today, three leaders of outstanding qualities receive what has become a world accolade for valiant efforts in pursuit of peace. 

Through their courageous initiatives, Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat and Shimon Perez, are redeeming a glorious culture and ancient civilisation, whose humane teachings live in the hearts of millions around the world. 

The giant step towards lasting peace in Palestine and Israel, and the region as a whole, which this Nobel Peace Prize rightfully acknowledges, is a crowning jewel to a deserving legion of peace warriors. 

It is an expression of confidence that, however daunting the problems, the time for peace has come to pass. 

With all humility, and from the bottom of my heart, I congratulate you my brothers. Democratic South Africa joins you as you celebrate a miracle in the making.
