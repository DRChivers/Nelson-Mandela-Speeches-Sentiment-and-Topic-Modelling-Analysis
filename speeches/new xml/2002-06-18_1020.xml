Your Excellencies 

Distinguished Guests 

Ladies and Gentlemen 

Allow me in return to propose a toast to His Excellency the Prime Minister, to the Hellenic Republic and to its people. 

No democracy in the world can celebrate itself without paying homage to this ancient cradle of democracy. We all owe part of our democratic self-understanding to this heritage. 

As one of the youngest democracies in the world, South Africa salutes that tradition and heritage. 

I ask you to join me in a toast to His Excellency, Prime Minister Simitis; the Hellenic Republic; and the people of Greece. 

And to the continuing strengthening of relations between our countries and our people.</body></text></speech>
