He will be visiting the Republic of Mali in accordance with a long- standing arrangement and will also be stopping over for discussions in the Republic of Togo. The visit to the region was originally scheduled to include the Republic of Guinea (Conakry), but due to the recent unfortunate events in the latter country, a visit there had to be postponed. At the request of the Guinean authorities, arrangements will be made for a visit by President Mandela to their country at a later date. 

The President's visit to the West African Region will underline the importance which South Africa attaches to closer substantial relations with the region. The South African Government holds the view that the expansion of economic ties between this mineral-rich region - in which Mali with its considerable gold reserves occupies a prominent position - and Southern Africa could play an important role in the economic development of both regions and thus make a major contribution to the well-being of all the people of our continent.</body></text></speech>
