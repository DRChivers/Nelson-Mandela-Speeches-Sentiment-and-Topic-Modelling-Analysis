President Nelson Mandela and Reverend Stanley Mogoba, President of the PAC have noted reports in some media pursuing the matter of the PAC's participation in the Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence in a manner that creates the false impression of animosity between government and the PAC. 

Both leaders wish to reiterate that the matter was discussed and amicably resolved at their meeting on Sunday 21 September. As they indicated at the media briefing after the meeting, President Mandela and Reverend Dr Mogoba accept each other's integrity and they are resolved to work together to strengthen unity in action between their organisations, in pursuit of a better future for all South Africans, especially the black majority disadvantaged by years of colonial domination. 

This strategic objective stands at the core of relations between the two leaders and their organisations; and they are at one that nothing should be allowed to distract from this aim.
