Dear Makhaya, 
Hearty congratulations as you play your one hundredth cricket test. What you have achieved goes beyond the number of matches you played; you have demonstrated, especially to the youth of our country, that everyone can rise above their circumstances and achieve success if they are dedicated to and passionate about what they do. 
We are proud of you! 
Sincerely 
N R Mandela
