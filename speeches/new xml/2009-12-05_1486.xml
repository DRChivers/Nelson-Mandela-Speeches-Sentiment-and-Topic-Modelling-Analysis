The Nokwe Family 

Duma Nokwe was one of the giants of our struggle for freedom. We pay tribute to his contributions as a leader within the African National Congress, as an outstanding lawyer, and as an intellectual. We were friends and colleagues for many years, and we were deeply saddened, while in prison, to hear of his premature death. We join the rest of the nation in remembering his commitment to the ideals that today underpin our young democracy. 

Yours sincerely 

Nelson Mandela
