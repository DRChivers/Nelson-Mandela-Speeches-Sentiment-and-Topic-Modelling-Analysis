Friends, 20 years ago London hosted a historic concert which called for our freedom. Your voices carried across the water to inspire us in our prison cells far away. Tonight, we are free. We are honoured to be back in London. 

As we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. Where there is poverty and sickness, including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done. Our work is for freedom for all ... We say tonight, after nearly 90 years of life, it is time for new hands to lift the burdens. It is in your hands now, I thank you.
