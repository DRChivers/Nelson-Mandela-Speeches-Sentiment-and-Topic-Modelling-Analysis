Distinguished visitors from [the] National Basketball Association and Players Union 

Friends 

Basketball is one of the biggest growing sport in South Africa. I am extremely pleased that the National Basketball, the most successful and most famous basketball organisation in the world, has decided to hold clinics in South Africa. I am certain that the knowledge your players and coaches are going to impart will inspire our youngsters to emulate the feats of your famous "dream team". 

Sport is a very important component in uniting any society and that is why the ANC and I personally lifted international sports sanctions. We have been totally vindicated on this issue as sport in our country is already beginning to unite our people. 

We are undergoing a very difficult time during this crucial period leading 'up to our first-ever democratic elections. I am certain that by the end of your visit here you will understand why we are seeking the assistance of people from all over the world. 

I understand that the National Basketball Association and the Players Union will be bringing a team to tour South Africa this time next year. We have great optimism that by your next visit we will be welcoming you to a democratic united South Africa.
