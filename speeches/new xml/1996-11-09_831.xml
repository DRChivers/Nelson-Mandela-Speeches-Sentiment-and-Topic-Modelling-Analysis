It gives me great pleasure to convey my warmest greetings to all Hindus on this very special occasion. 

The Festival of Lights brings families, friends and communities together to rejuvenate spiritual forces and to celebrate the triumph of good over evil. 

May Deepavali continue to rekindle family ties and renew the will to strive towards the achievement of a better life for all. Everyone can draw pride, at this time of sharing, in their efforts to bring sunshine into the hearts of others. 

It is with intense joy that I extend my sincerest wishes for a happy Deepavali to our fellow citizens and those across the globe. 

I send a message of love and peace to each of you celebrating Deepavali.
