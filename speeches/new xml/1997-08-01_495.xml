It has therefore been a pleasure for me to participate as Patron-in-Chief at the celebrations of the 75th Jubilee of the Faculty of Health Sciences. 

The Faculty of Health Sciences has made a major contribution to our countryâ€™s development and advancement for over three quarters of a century. Graduates from the health professions have helped to extend quality health services throughout the country. Biomedical and health systems research scientists have contributed to the body of knowledge and thereby to improvements in health. The extension of training, research and service provision across Gauteng and your pioneering work in Tintswalo has been recorded and admired. 

I am confident that you will rise with distinction to the challenges of reforming our health services and redirecting health resources towards primary care. We look to you to ensure that generations of young South Africans from communities previously denied access to your institution, will achieve the scientific distinction and success recorded by their eminent predecessors. We feel confident that your graduates will be honoured to fulfill their obligations to improve the health of our people. 

By choosing as the theme for your conference, "Health Beyond 2000", you have given notice of your intention to continue to meet your vitally important responsibilities in health through the next millennium. I wish you every success in your deliberations.</body></text></speech>
