It is a great pleasure to extend my warmest greetings to the Hindu community on the occasion of the Festival of Lights. 

May this festive season and the year that lies ahead be filled with peace, happiness, joy and prosperity. 

The South African Hindu community continues to make a significant contribution to the advancement of the nation. It is a community striving hand-in-hand with its compatriots, to ensure that South Africa realises her enormous potential. 

The major challenge facing South Africans is that of transforming the lives of all our people for the better in our new democracy. Such a transformation will be in keeping with the spirit of Deepavali - the triumph of light over darkness, and of good over evil. 

I wish you all a Happy Deepavali !
