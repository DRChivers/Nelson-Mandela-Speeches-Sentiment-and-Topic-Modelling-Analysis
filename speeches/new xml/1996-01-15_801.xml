The one-to-one meeting between the President and the King was broached at, and unanimously supported by, the consultation President Mandela held on 15 December last year with KwaZulu-Natal traditional leaders. 

President Mandela intends, after this meeting, to hold further discussions with Chief Buthelezi, as well as the leader of the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal, Jacob Zuma, on the steps required to normalise the situation in this Province. He hopes to meet the King once more, accompanied by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 

The President is confident that this and other initiatives will help bring an end to the violence afflicting parts of KwaZulu-Natal, ensure free political activity and the optimum implementation of reconstruction and development projects in the Province. 

President Mandela once again calls on the people of KwaZulu-Natal to embrace peace and tolerance. While commending the security forces for the work they have done thus far, he further calls on them to intensify the programme aimed at eradicating the violence, including systematic action to bring the perpetrators to book.</body></text></speech>
