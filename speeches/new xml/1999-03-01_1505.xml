To be so honoured for fighting for those ideals - freedom, democracy and world peace - which were ages ago already nourished in the sacred ground of Olympia, inspired us to continue that struggle. 

I have been informed of the plans to re-establish the Olympic Truce that in antiquity all participants in the Olympic games were required to observe, obliging them to cease all hostilities during that period. This development may, we hope, give further impetus to the idea of universal peace in our time and to the discouragement of war. 

This initiative therefore has my full support. I join you in wishing for a world of peace in our lifetime. 

Strength and best wishes to all who are engaged in this noble cause.
