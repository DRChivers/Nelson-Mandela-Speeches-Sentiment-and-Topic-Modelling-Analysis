President Mandela paid a State Visit to Indonesia from 14 to 16 July 1997. Subsequent to wide-ranging discussions with President Suharto, a private meeting between President Mandela and Mr Xanana Gusmao, the imprisoned leader of Fretilin, an East Timor resistance movement, was arranged by the Indonesian authorities. 

With regard to East Timor the South African Government has always had an interest in a peaceful solution to the situation based on dialogue between all concerned parties. In this connection South Africa supports the tripartite initiative facilitated by the United Nations Secretary General, as well as the intra-East Timor dialogue. 

To further enhance its understanding of the situation South Africa has had contact with all parties including the Nobel Peace laureates, Bishop Ximenes Belo, the Roman Catholic Bishop of East Timor, and Mr Jose Ramos-Horta, a prominent opposition leader of the National Council Mauberian Resistance of East Timor. 

Mr Ramos-Horta will arrive in South Africa on 25 July 1997 and will meet with President Mandela. An invitation will also be extended to Bishop Belo to visit South Africa.
