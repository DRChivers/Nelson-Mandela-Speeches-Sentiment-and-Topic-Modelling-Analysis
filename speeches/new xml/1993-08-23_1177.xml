His sporting prowess in a discipline where few black people participated gave pride, dignity and confidence to millions of disadvantaged youth. 

His fortitude in dealing with illness was remarkable. 

I am honoured to be a small part of this AIDS benefit tournament, and heartened to know that Arthur's courage lives on both through the sport he loved and triumphed in, and through continued efforts to fight a terrible disease which must be combated through education, openness and caring. 

For many of us, during the years we were shut out of society, Arthur brought renewed resilience into our lives. 

I was deeply touched when I received his biography while in Pollsmoor Prison. The life experience that I learned of on paper was made real when Arthur and I met, first during his visit to South Africa, and later in 1991 when I was in the United States. 

These were memorable occasions, and remain among my most cherished encounters. It was a privilege to have known Arthur. He will never be forgotten.</body></text></speech>
