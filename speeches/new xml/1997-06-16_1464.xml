Dear Matthew 

It is with a deep sense of honour that I once more send a message of encouragement and good wishes to a South African national team. I feel even more honoured that I am directing it to our Under-20 squad. 

It is common to say to a team of your calibre that you are the stars and champions of the future, in anticipation of the role all of you should play in Bafana Bafana soon. But you have brought glory to your country already. Your achievements in the Africa Youth Championships are unequalled. You are the first South African team to qualify for a continental championship. Now you are the first to earn a place in a world contest. I am, therefore, very proud of you and I am certain that the South African people share similar feelings about you. You have made it your calling to bring joy and celebration to your country and people. 

I am sending this message to you on June 16th, South African Youth Day, a day on which we celebrate the achievements of our youth and honour them for their contributions in reconstructing and developing our country. 

The amount of goodwill your achievements generate for our country is invaluable. I consider myself exceptionally fortunate to be blessed with young men and women of your stature as our ambassadors. I am confident that you will acquit yourselves well in the World Youth Soccer Championship. 

I wish you luck and success. 

Sincerely 

Nelson Mandela President Republic of South Africa
