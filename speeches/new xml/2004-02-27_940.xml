Trustees and Staff of the Nelson Mandela Foundation 
Ladies and Gentlemen 
Let me start by heartily thanking FCB Harlow Butler, who of course trades and is known in South Africa as ICAP. 
I am pleased to be here tonight to thank Mr de Klerk, his staff and clients for supporting the HIV/AIDS and Education programmes of the Nelson Mandela Foundation. 
Tonight, we have chosen to celebrate the spirit of giving. 
There can be no greater gift than that of giving of ones time and energy to help others without expecting anything in return. ICAP helps us appreciate that form of caring and generosity. 
Over the years, we have received the support of many good men, women and children from throughout the world. 
That support has allowed us to continue our work particularly in the disadvantaged rural areas of South Africa. We have done this through, amongst other things, providing resources and support to schools; integrating schools with the communities in which they operate; advocating for a comprehensive approach to HIV/AIDS to include treatment, prevention, education, caring, support and the breakdown of stigmatisation. 
Friends, there is still much that needs to be done. The Nelson Mandela Foundation sees its role as a catalyst for change and development. We develop strategic alliances and partnerships in order to foster community engagement and to ensure the community takes ownership of the project. 
We invite you to work with us, as no one organisation can take on this responsibility by itself. We invite the spontaneous, whole-hearted support of people from all walks of life. We invite governments, business, labour and communities to participate fully in strengthening the foundations of a peaceful, prosperous and inclusive society in this wonderful land of ours. 
I thank you.</body></text></speech>
