The launch of South African Airways' new corporate identity is the most significant milestone in the 63 years of its existence. Now that our nation is free, it is appropriate that the airline's new livery should reflect the colours of our new national flag. 
South African Airways will now have the advantage of being a true national flag carrier, representing the free spirit of our colourful and diverse land. 
The airline will be a better ambassador for our country, carrying the symbols, the hopes and the aspirations of all our people to the far corners of the globe. 
I congratulate each of the airline's employees for their achievements. And trust that the rebirth of the airline will instil in them the determination to make SAA one of the giants of world aviation. 
The nation stands fully behind you as you reach for the stars.
