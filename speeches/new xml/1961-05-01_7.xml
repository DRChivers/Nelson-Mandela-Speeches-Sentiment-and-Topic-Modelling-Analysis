Question: Do you advocate peaceful demonstrations for May 31? 

Answer: My association with the present campaign is now public knowledge. Everyone knows that I advocate such demonstrations. My answer is simply - yes. 

Question: What form should the demonstrations around Republic Day take? 

Answer: The programme includes a national stoppage of work for a number of days, the holding of meetings and processions. The details vary in different areas according to local issues. 

Question: What aim should the demonstrations - against a republic on which our people have not been consulted - aim at? 

Answer: The people will be called upon to continue their protests until their grievances are met. Alternatively, we want the government to call an all-in national convention to discuss an entirely new constitution here.
