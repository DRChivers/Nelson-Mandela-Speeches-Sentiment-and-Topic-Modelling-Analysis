You will know from your recent visit to South Africa, the warmth in the hearts of all our people towards you; towards the people of Britain; and the Commonwealth of Nations. 
History has given our two countries a long and complex relationship. It had its share of difficulties, but the joint efforts of our peoples in pursuit of freedom has made the antagonisms a thing of the past and laid a basis of hope for the future. 
We appreciate in particular your role in helping build the Commonwealth into an association which stands for I look forward eagerly to visiting your country later this year. it will be an opportunity to lend still greater strength to the bonds that are growing between our countries and our peoples. 
Once again, may I wish Your Majesty a happy birthday and good health.</body></text></speech>
