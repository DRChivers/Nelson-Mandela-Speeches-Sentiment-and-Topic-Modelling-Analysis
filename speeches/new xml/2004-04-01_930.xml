Today marks the next phase of our 46664 campaign : the global launch of our very special DVD and CDs of the wonderful concert we enjoyed in Cape Town. 

It features music and art, messages from world leaders and supporters. Money raised will support the work of the Nelson Mandela Foundation to help the 30 million of my fellow Africans living with HIV/AIDS. 

To win this fight, we all must do more. Do more to tell people about prevention. Do more to fund those making such a difference on the frontline to fight HIV. Do more to ensure that people receive the care, the treatment and the support they need when they have AIDS. 

I would like to thank all the amazing people that are helping us in this fight. I can announce that all of the artists that performed at the concert in Cape Town have agreed to be 46664 Ambassadors. They will help us raise awareness about HIV/AIDS in Africa and help those infected and affected by this pandemic. 

By supporting 46664, we can unite in the fight to do more. Do more to try secure a future for everyone, everywhere free from HIV/AIDS. 

I thank you.</body></text></speech>
