On the occasion of your 70th birthday we add our voice to those of many who will be marking it by acknowledging the contributions you have made to the diverse landscape that is South Africa. 
It was with confidence that we appointed you as our first ambassador to the United States following the 1994 election. Your knowledge of and wisdom in public affairs ensured an important and satisfactory relationship between the United States and South Africa during the first post-apartheid administration. Your commitment to the fight for justice, freedom and equality has earned you respect worldwide. 
It is fitting that we pay tribute to you at this milestone moment in your personal journey. We wish you many healthy and happy years to come. 
Happy Birthday!
