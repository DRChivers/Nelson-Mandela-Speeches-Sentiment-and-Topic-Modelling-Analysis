The President has noted that the bulk of the issues referred to in the conclusion to the report are indeed the subject of a Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Premier of Mpumalanga. 

The outstanding matter - concerning the question of whether there were any improper conduct relating to "family or other close relations involved in the awarding of the project to Motheo Construction (Pty) Ltd" - does not in the President's view warrant the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry. The President notes that according to the Auditor-General, unspecified media allegations constitute the basis for recommending such an enquiry, and that no evidence emerged specifically from the Auditor-General's report in support thereof. 

It is precisely to investigate such matters that the Constitution establishes the Office of the Public Protector. The President has every confidence that, if requested, the Public Protector will do so impartially and expeditiously. 

On the other hand a Commission of Inquiry would be a clumsy, expensive and very lengthy way of investigating a media allegation of improper conduct pertaining to a friend or relative of a political office bearer. It is for these reasons that Parliament has charged the Public Protector with such functions. Any person or interested party, including the Department or Ministry, has the right to request such an enquiry by the Public Protector.</body></text></speech>
