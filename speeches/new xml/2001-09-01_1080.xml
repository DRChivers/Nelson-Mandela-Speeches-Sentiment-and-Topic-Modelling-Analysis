HIVAIDS is the greatest danger we have faced for many, many centuries. 

HIV/AIDS is worse than a war. It is like a world war. Millions of people are dying from it. As we speak now, there are thousands of people dying from it this moment. 

But this war can be won. This is one war where each one of us can make a difference. 

This effort to raise funds for the SOS Villages in order to provide and care for destitute children infected by HIV/AIDS is a most praiseworthy contribution to that combined fight. There is nothing more terrible than to see children suffering and our hearts go out especially to those infected by HIV/AIDS. As in all wars, they - the children - are the innocent victims that bear the brunt of the suffering. 

An evening like this also importantly helps to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS. One of the greatest enemies in this battle is ignorance and denial. Any opportunity at raising awareness should be utilised, and we commend the organisers for their efforts. 

Together we can win this war.</body></text></speech>
