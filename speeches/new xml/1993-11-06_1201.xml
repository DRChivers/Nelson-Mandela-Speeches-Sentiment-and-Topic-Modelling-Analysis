For decades we were silenced. 
Our voice could be heard only through others. 
For decades we were banned. 
Our views were expressed in secret meetings, underground leaflets, radio broadcasts from neighbouring countries. 
For decades we were made invisible. 
In prisons, in exile, in our daily lives, unable to display our name, our glorious colours that symbolise our resistance, the flame of freedom burning in our hearts. 
But together we fought by all means possible until we forced the regime to accept negotiations. Now our efforts are starting to bear fruit. 
Now is the time for freedom! 
Six months from now you will, for the first time ever, elect a government of your choice. A government that must represent you. Stand for you. Address your needs, your hopes, your concerns. Be accountable to you. A government that must do away with the evils brought by apartheid. A government that must bring peace, jobs and a better life for all South Africans. It is a government whose policies must be shaped by the people. 
Now is your time to speak! 
The ANC is your organisation. Millions of you have struggled to bring us to this dawn of freedom. Thousands have sacrificed that most precious gift of all, life itself. We have struggled together. Together we hope for peace, freedom and a better life for all. Together let us change South Africa. 
And because we are your organisation, we want to listen to what you have to say. We want to hear your views. We have begun work on a plan.
