We are pleased that the Soweto Heritage Trust has undertaken the restoration refurbishment and upgrading of our family’s old Soweto property. 
The heritage of this humble dwelling is of course one of struggle and sacrifice, but it is also one that demonstrates the ability of the human spirit to triumph over adversity. It is the heritage not only of one family, but that of all the people of Soweto and of our nation who refused to bow down to tyranny or succumb to bitterness. 
It is fitting that number 8115 Ngakane Street, Soweto, should now become part of a community of institutions dedicated to ensuring that our country’s history is preserved and made accessible to future generations. There is much we can learn from the past as we chart the future. This was the vision which informed our decision to place the property in the custody of the Trust originally. 
Congratulations to all the dedicated fundraisers, funders, researchers, designers and curators who have made this possible. 
We wish you every success in this important endeavour. 
I thank you
