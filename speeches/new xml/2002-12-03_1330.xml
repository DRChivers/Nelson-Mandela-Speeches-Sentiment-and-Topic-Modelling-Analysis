It is a threat to everything and to everybody. This disease endangers many of the developmental, social and economic gains that we have made since 1994. It is destroying our most valuable resource - our people. 
Without people we cannot steer this country on a path to sustainable development. Today, more than one in ten persons are infected with HIV in our country. As the number of people becoming infected increases, poverty levels deepen that still plague so many of our communities. 
The vast majority of people infected with the virus remains untreated. 
They are in desperate need of our help. Apart from creating awareness and caring for people that are infected and affected with HIV/AIDS, we must help these people access treatment so they are able to live positive lives, contribute to their communities and remain among us as long as possible. 
My Foundation has adopted a holistic approach to HIV/AIDS. On the one hand, we are addressing the issues of care, support and stigma through mobilising leadership in the fight against HIV/AIDS and through targeted research. On the other, we build partnerships with institutions that are involved in making treatment available to people infected. Last week, we brought 26 different constituencies involved in HIV/AIDS-Treatment at the table in a conference in Durban. 
Today's launch of the Provincial Pilot Programme with the South African Medical Association is another important step in this direction. However, none of these initiatives must stand in isolation. It is only through the joint efforts from government, communities and all relevant constituencies that we will be able to win the fight against this pandemic. 
Let us stand together in the fight against HIV/AIDS.</body></text></speech>
