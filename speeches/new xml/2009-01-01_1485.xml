Three years later South Africa was honoured to host this important gathering. In many ways the world has changed since those years. The challenges facing humankind have multiplied. The importance of information and communication technologies to human development has grown. 
These technologies have transformed the way people live and the manner in which countries develop. They have the potential to enable us to solve many of the critical problems confronting us. If this potential is to be realised, then we must find ways of turning these technologies into a resource for all people despite the challenges they face within their communities. 
We wish Telecom World 2009 well in its deliberations. And we wish the ITU success in what must be its central mission - to connect the world, bridge divides, and promote human development. 
I thank you.</body></text></speech>
