He wishes to congratulate Justice Picard and his commission for a job well done in getting to the bottom of some of the problems besetting the administration of soccer in South Africa. The President has been assured by Minister Tshwete that the process leading to the proposed Soccer Indaba will be initiated without delay. 

President Mandela is convinced that this Indaba, if organised in an impartial and professional manner, will put in place the necessary structures, regulations and practices that will ensure better administration of soccer in the interest of all stake-holders, particularly the soccer players and supporters. 

The President wishes to congratulate the National Soccer team and other players - both professional and otherwise - for the commitment with which they are pursuing excellence, and he wishes one more to assure them of his full support. 

He also wishes to thank all South Africans for supporting the national team, and he is convinced that this support will continue as we work together to ensure that our soccer players and supporters are serviced in the professional manner they deserve.</body></text></speech>
