As you may know, I recently formally announced my retirement from public life so I should really not be doing this. 
However, as long as poverty, injustice and gross inequality persist in our world, none of us can truly rest. 
And I am sad to say that in this new century, millions of people in the world's poorest countries remain imprisoned, enslaved, and in chains. 
They are trapped in the prison of poverty. It is time to set them free. And like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is man-made and can be overcome and eradicated by the action of human beings. 
This year is a unique opportunity to do just that. The G8 leaders, when they meet in Scotland in July, have already promised to focus on the issue of poverty, especially in Africa. 
The steps that they must take to bring this about are very clear. The first is ensuring trade justice. 
The second is an end to the debt crisis for the poorest countries. The third is to deliver much more aid and make sure it is of the highest quality. 
I say to all those leaders: do not look the other way; do not hesitate. Recognise that the world is hungry for action, not words. Act with courage and vision. I say to everyone else do not let your leaders look away. 
I am proud to wear this white band tonight. Sometimes it falls upon a generation to be great. You can be that great generation. Let your greatness blossom. 
Let us work to make poverty history this year and then we can all stand with our heads held high. 
Thank you.</body></text></speech>
