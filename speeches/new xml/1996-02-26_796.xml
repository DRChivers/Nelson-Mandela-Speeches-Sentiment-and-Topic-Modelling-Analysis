A report in the Business Day today (26/2/96) alleging that Deputy President Thabo Mbeki intervened to reinstate an inquiry by the Parliamentary Health Portfolio Committee into a contract to produce a drama focusing on Aids awareness contains various factual inaccuracies and is misleading. 

Contrary to the Business Day's allegations, there was no instruction from President Mandela to the Committee to cancel a meeting which was to be addressed by the Minister of Health Nkosazana Zuma, wherein she was to give a report into the process of awarding the contract. 

It is further alleged in the story that Mrs. Zuma refused to meet with the Committee. This is also incorrect. Minister Zuma at no point in time refused to meet with the Committee. 

Deputy President Mbeki's intervention was a follow-up on the President's initiative to ensure that the matter be resolved without needless public wrangling based on speculation rather than fact. 

Both the Offices of the President and the Deputy President would like to reiterate the absolute importance of the separation of the legislative and executive arms of government. The imperative of the parliamentary structures in resolving the question at hand derives from the principle guiding all modern democracies. 

Equally important is the need to ensure that the discussions of the Minister, the Department of Health and the Portfolio Committee are not pre-empted.
