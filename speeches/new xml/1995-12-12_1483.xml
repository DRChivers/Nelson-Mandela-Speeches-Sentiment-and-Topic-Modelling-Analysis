In particular, reference has been made to the President's and the government's approach to the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, Morocco and the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, the situation in Nigeria, as well as Indonesia and East Timor. 
The President wishes to reiterate that South Africa's foreign policy is based on the government's assessment of our country's interests and our principled stance on issues of human rights, demo-cracy, development and equitable relations among all states. The process of setting up formal relations with any country is under- taken within the context of these considerations, and in consulta- tion with all interested parties. 
In his capacity as leader of the ANC, President Mandela has indeed raised funds to ensure that this organisation discharges its functions, a process which has made it possible for South Africa to undergo the transition that we have achieved. Such funds, and other forms of support, have been acquired from virtually all countries that the President has visited or interacted with - including the countries which are alleged in media reports to have been disadvantaged in comparison with others on account of some pecuniary considerations. 
We hope that the media will handle these matters with circumspection, and ensure, at least, that clarification is sought with relevant government structures, before such serious allegations are made.
