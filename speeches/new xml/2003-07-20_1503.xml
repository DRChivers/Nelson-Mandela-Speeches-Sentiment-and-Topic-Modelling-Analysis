I trust I did not falter. I made missteps along the way but I have discovered the secret that after crossing a great hill one only finds that there are many more hills to cross. I have taken a rest here for a moment to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back where I came. But I can only rest for a moment because with freedom comes responsibilities. I dare not linger for the road to freedom is not yet ended. 

I thank you.</body></text></speech>
