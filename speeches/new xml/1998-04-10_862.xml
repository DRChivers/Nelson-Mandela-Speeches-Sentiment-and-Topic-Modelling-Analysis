On behalf of the Government and the people of South Africa, I would like to express our congratulations on the agreement reached to all the negotiators and leaders involved in the Northern Ireland Peace Process. I am delighted that this agreement will bring the opportunity for peace and prosperity to the people of Northern Ireland. 

I would also like to encourage all parties to work towards the successful implementation of the details of the agreement. This is one of the most significant milestones in the history of Northern Ireland. I commend the leadership of the people of Northern Ireland as well as the Prime Ministers of Ireland and the United Kingdom for their bold and unstinting efforts to bring peace and stability to the area. Their leadership will continue to be of crucial importance in the weeks and months ahead. This historic breakthrough has once again demonstrated the value of negotiation and consultation rather than confrontation and upheaval. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Northern Ireland.
