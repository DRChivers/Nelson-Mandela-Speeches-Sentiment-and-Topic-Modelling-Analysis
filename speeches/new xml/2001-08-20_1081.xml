It was with great sadness that we learnt of the death of Donald Woods. We convey our sincere condolences to his wife Wendy and the rest of the family. We trust that in these times of bereavement they will find some solace in the knowledge that their sense of loss is shared by millions of South Africans. 
Donald Woods was an outstanding South African, one of those who inspired others by his public example. He was uncompromising in his opposition to racism and racial discrimination. At the height of apartheid his newspaper campaigned fearlessly against the basic tenets of that policy. He lived his own life in ways that demonstrated his commitment to the principles he preached. 
We shall remember him as a personal friend who gave selflessly of himself to advance the cause of his country.
