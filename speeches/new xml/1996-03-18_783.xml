President Nelson Mandela has noted with shock and dismay the murder of members of the South African Police Service over the weekend. According to information received, three policemen were killed at Magoda near Pietermaritzburg yesterday, and one member of the Service was killed in Isipingo on Saturday. 

The President condemns in the strongest terms possible this heinous murder of members of the nation's security services; and, on behalf of the Government of National Unity, vows to ensure that the murderers are brought to book and punished to the full extent of the law. 

President Mandela extends his heart-felt condolences to the bereaved families and to the South African Police Service. 

The Government calls on members of the community to assist the police in tracking down these and other criminals. Together, let us ensure that all the country's citizens are afforded the safety and security they deserve.
