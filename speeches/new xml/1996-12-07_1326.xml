1. Before the ANC's Western Cape Provincial Congress the prophets of doom predicted leadership struggles and division. They were proved totally wrong by the delegates who in a responsible and purposeful way put the political interests of the ANC and our people first. 
2. Yours was a shining example of how to make a priority of unity. Personalities were subordinated to political goals and a programme of action triumphed over individual ambition. 
3. I would like to congratulate each of the comrades elected to the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC). A special word of congratulation goes to Comrade DuIlah Omar. The congress made am outstanding choice in selecting him as leader. He is one of the most capable and loved leaders of the ANC and I have no doubt that he will make a great success of the great task which has been given him. 
4. I would also like to congratulate everyone involved in the congress, on the programme of action that was adopted. The emphasis on organisation is encouraging. The fact that it is combined with commitment to realising the ideals of the Reconstruction and Development Programme shows that Congress set the right goals. 
5. But programmes of action mean little on paper. Only when a programme is implemented can we claim success. We need a lot more work and harder work by everyone in the ANC among our alliance partners id the lives of our people are to be improved.</body></text></speech>
