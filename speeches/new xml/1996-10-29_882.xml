Hansie and the Team 

Once more you have done us proud. Earlier this month you lifted the Heroes' Cup in Kenya without a single loss. That victory was followed by Coopers & Lybrand Ratings deservedly placing you as the best in the world in one-day cricket. And now this morning you booked your place in the finals of the Titans' Cup with a sterling performance. 

Throughout the tour you have kept the Rainbow Flag flying high. The whole nation will be with you on the day of the final, cheering your every move. 

Congratulations and Good Luck in the finals!
