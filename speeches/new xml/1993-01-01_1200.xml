For far longer than living memory we have known degradation and humiliation; witnessed unspeakable crimes in the name of racial superiority. The graves of our ancestors lie on Robben Island; our children know only ignorance, hunger, poverty and disease. 

The legacy of apartheid permeates the very fabric of our society. It will take iron will and enormous resources to rebuild millions of shattered lives. 

Our people cry out for peace, jobs and justice. We want them to have hope, to have a future - freedom, education, family life, job security and dignity in the land of their birth. 

After years of discussions, negotiations are finally beginning to bear fruit. While many obstacles still remain, we are determined that a date be set for elections this year. 

These elections are unprecedented in our history. They will be the first in which African people will vote for a government of their choice. These elections will not be a contest between different political organisations; they will be a contest between freedom and oppression; between the end of white minority rule or continued domination under a different guise.</body></text></speech>
