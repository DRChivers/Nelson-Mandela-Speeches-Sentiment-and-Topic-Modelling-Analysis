We have been pleased and honoured by the way Mandela Day has been responded to. People have made it an occasion, not to focus on one day but rather to work with each other in communities to make the world a better place. Most importantly they have gone beyond the 67 seconds or one day and have found ways to promote continuing work that can make a difference. 

I thank each one of you who made a contribution. We value your continued support.
