As the Constitutional Court President indicated, the substance of the draft constitution complies with the requirements of the Constitutional Principles, and the areas that need amendment should not pose any difficulty. 
The Court judgement helps to clarify issues that were vaguely formulated in the Constitutional Principles adopted at multi-party negotiations in 1993; and it will ensure that the final draft strictly adheres to both the letter and the spirit of those principles. 
The draft as adopted by the Constitutional Assembly is the property of all the parties who were engaged in negotiations; and the President is confident that the spirit of co-operation which characterised negotiations in the CA will prevail, to ensure that the constitution is finalised in the shortest possible time.
