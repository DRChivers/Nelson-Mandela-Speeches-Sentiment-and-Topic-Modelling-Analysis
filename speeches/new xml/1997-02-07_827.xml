It gives me great pleasure to extend my special greetings to all Muslims on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, as they mark the end of Ramadaan. 

This month of fasting promotes moral strength, physical fitness and spiritual rejuvenation. I am confident that it has raised each individual's awareness of the plight of the less fortunate. 

South Africa needs the continued contribution of the Muslim community in every sphere - business, sport, science, the professions, the arts and leadership - to help mould our beautiful rainbow nation. The Muslim community are held in high esteem for their valuable contribution in building this great nation. 

I wish all Muslims a joyous and peaceful Eid-ul-Fitr.
