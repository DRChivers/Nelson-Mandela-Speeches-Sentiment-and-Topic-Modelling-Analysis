On behalf of the Government and the people of South Africa, and on my own behalf, I would like to express profound shock and utter dismay at the explosion yesterday in Omagh, Northern Ireland. 

I would urge the people of the United Kingdom and Ireland and the leaders and parties involved in the Good Friday Agreement to continue to pursue its aims for peace and stability even more steadfastly and not allow this repulsive act to deter them. The overwhelming positive results in the recent Irish referendums showed a determined desire for peace rather than conflict and violence. So much goodwill and faith should not be lost to the mindless violence of a few. 

Please accept South Africa's deepest sympathy at the lives lost. We mourn with the families of the deceased and pray for a speedy recovery of the injured.
