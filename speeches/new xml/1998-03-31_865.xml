President Nelson Mandela will only conclude his activities related to his voyage abroad the luxury liner, the Queen Elizabeth II, late in the evening in Cape Town. 

The President will therefore not be able to meet the members of the Mohamed Commission as was announced earlier. 

President Mandela will now meet the members of the Commission, Justices Mohamed, Langa and Goldstone on Wednesday, 1 April 1998 at his Lower Houghton home in Johannesburg. The meeting will take place in the afternoon.
