We wish to share with you and the people of Israel our sense of shock and sadness at the death of your national Ilan Ramon in the Columbia space tragedy. 

We are aware of the pride the Israeli people took in Colonel Ramon as the first Israeli to enter space, and the loss they must feel at his tragic death. We think particularly of his family and loved ones and would want to have our feelings conveyed to them. 

Please remain assured, Mister Prime Minister, of our highest esteem.
