For a small country here on the southern tip of Africa to have produced two Nobel Prize winners in literature is indeed a remarkable achievement. We convey our warmest congratulations to J M Coetzee and would want him to know how proud he has made all of us. He might have emigrated but we shall continue to claim him as our own. His consistent portrayal of the violence and distortions of colonialism and apartheid have made him an intellectual hero in the history of our country.</body></text></speech>
