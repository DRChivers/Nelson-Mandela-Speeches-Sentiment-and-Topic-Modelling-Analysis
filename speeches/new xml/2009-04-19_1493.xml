Dear Comrades and friends, as we strive to secure a decisive victory for our organization in the upcoming elections, let us remember our primary task. It is to eradicate poverty and ensure a better life for all. 

The ANC has the historic responsibility to lead our nation and help build a united, non-racial society. 

Working together we can do more. 

I thank you.
