I am delighted to speak to all South Africans on this Christmas Day. 

Just as this period of goodwill is the time to thank the Lord for the blessings on our nation in this past year, it is also a moment of deserved relaxation with our loved ones, especially the children. It is a time for sharing. 

As we enjoy this great moment, we should also remember the children who do not enjoy the care of parents or loved ones. There are many citizens, too, who cannot fend for themselves, confined in hospital or disadvantaged in many other ways. Let us show them compassion during this period and beyond. 

Each one of us should draw pride from our efforts to bring sunshine into the hearts of others. 

Let this Christmas period be the time for us to renew our commitment to work together as one nation to build a better life for all South Africans. 

I send a message of love and peace to all fellow citizens and our friends across the globe. Let us embrace one another and build on the spirit of reconciliation that has become the hallmark of our rainbow nation. 

As we rejoice in the wonderful year we were blessed with, let us pray to be peacemakers and builders of a harmonious nation. 

Let peace reside in all our hearts!
