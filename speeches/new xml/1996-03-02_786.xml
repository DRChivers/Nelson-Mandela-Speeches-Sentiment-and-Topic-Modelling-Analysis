Dear Thulani `Sugarboy' Malinga 

On behalf of all South Africans I send warm greetings and best wishes to you as you prepare for your rematch against the World Boxing Council supermiddleweight champion Nigel Benn in Newcastle, England tomorrow night. 

South Africa is proud of you. 

Good Luck ! 

Signed Sincerely 

President Nelson Mandela
