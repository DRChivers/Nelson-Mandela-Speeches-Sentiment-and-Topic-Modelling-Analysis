I have received the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Complaints by Former African National Congress Prisoners and Detainees. 

An extended meeting of the National Working Committee considered the report on Friday, 16 October and decided to issue it to the public. 

The Extended NWC noted with grave concern that the findings of the Commission indicated that serious abuses and irregularities had occurred. These were in violation of the ANC's own Code of Conduct and ethics. 

Nevertheless, as a leadership, we accept ultimate responsibility for not adequately monitoring and therefore eradicating such abuses. 

Despite the alleged and sometimes proven serious crimes - at the service of the apartheid regime - for which various individuals were detained, we believe that the morality of our liberation struggle demanded. And still demands of us the highest moral and ethical standards. 

The NWC and I wish to thank the Commissioners for undertaking this crucial investigation with integrity and speed. 

Regrettably, the very speed with which the investigation had to be completed has meant that evidence was not heard from some individuals who could have assisted the Commission in arriving at its findings. 

Such evidence, in the view of the NWC, includes factual information about such issues as: 

- the difficult conditions under which all cadres and other persons under the care of the ANC lived, given our meagre resources; 

- the actual status of, and rules governing, such residential areas as Dakawa in Tanzania; 

- the inaccuracies in some of the sources which the Commission used as authoritative reference; and 

- the time frame within which most of the abuses occurred and the corrective measures undertaken. 

The specific recommendations of the Commission will be considered as a matter of urgency and appropriate action taken.
