I am absolutely delighted by the success of Orlando Pirates football club in the African Champions Cup competition. 

I must also salute their opposition Asec Abidjan. They are a wonderful team. 

Orlando Pirates has given South African football the incentive and confidence we need as we approach the African Nations Cup tournament in January 1996. 

They have done what every patriot is expected to do on behalf of his country and his people. 

May they go from strength to strength.
