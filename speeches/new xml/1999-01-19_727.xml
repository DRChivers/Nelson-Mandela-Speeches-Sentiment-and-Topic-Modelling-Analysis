Muslims throughout the world have been fasting daily from dawn to sunset. I am confident that you have emerged from this period of abstinence spiritually rejuvenated and fortified. 

Fasting is a trial of physical endurance. It helps build discipline and patience and is a time for deep reflection. But it is also a means of developing empathy for the poor and destitute. It's a bridge by which Muslims can reach out to the needy in all communities. 

Ramadaan and the celebration of Eid-ul-Fitr affords Muslims a unique opportunity to strengthen bonds of friendship and family ties among themselves and with their fellow South Africans. As you celebrate Eid together, I urge you to use the qualifies you have strengthened during Ramadaan to help build a better life for all. Let us all re-commit themselves to fight criminality, promote development, spread justice and create jobs for the unemployed. 

May I take this opportunity of wishing you Eid Mubarak and a prosperous future in our democracy.
