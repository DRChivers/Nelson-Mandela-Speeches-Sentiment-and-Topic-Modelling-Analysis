During Mr. Liebenberg's routine annual medical check-up last week, a problem was detected, for which he has undergone a successful operation. He will be home shortly. 

When Mr. Liebenberg resigned from office in March this year, he had no knowledge of this illness. He certainly did not resign from Cabinet because of ill health, but because he felt that the task that he had stepped in to fulfil had been completed. 

Since the Liebenbergs have now resumed private life, I would encourage everyone to respect their wishes for a quiet and restful period of recovery. I have extended the heartfelt wishes of the government to Mr. Liebenberg for a speedy recovery.</body></text></speech>
