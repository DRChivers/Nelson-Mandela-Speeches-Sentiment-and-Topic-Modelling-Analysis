Matthew Booth 

South African Under - 20 Soccer Team 

Dear Matthew, 

I have noted with great pride and satisfaction the success your team has achieved in the African Youth Soccer Championships in Morocco. 

I am even more delighted because your success is an indication of the firm foundation that is being laid in moulding South Africa into one of the most powerful footballing nations in the world. 

While your achievements have not captured the headlines in the media, the pride we have in your resides deep in the hearts of all South Africans. 

I am confident you will do well in the final and wish you all the luck. Be assured of unstinting support and indeed the support of the nation as a whole. My regards to your coach Shakes Mashaba and all the members of your squad and management.
