I was greatly shocked and saddened by the news of the train accident in Eschede in Northern Germany on 3 June 1998 and the tragic loss of so many lives. 

On behalf of the government and people of the Republic of South Africa, I wish to express my sincere condolences to yourself, your government and the people of the Federal Republic of Germany. Your country, its people and in particular the relatives affected by this tragedy will remain in our hearts and minds in this time of bereavement. 

Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurance of my highest consideration.</body></text></speech>
