Today, nationally and internationally World Aids Day celebrations will focus on the plight of affected and infected people. It should however not signal a day's commitment but something we exercise every day of our lives. 
 This event in Bloemfontein, organised by my Foundation will focus on the role of leaders both in our country and elsewhere. 
Traditional Leaders form an important part of the country's leadership. It is for this reason that 1 have met and appealed to them to support my call that they become involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS. 
 As leaders it is our responsibility to fight stigma and discrimination of affected people. We must take the lead in providing them with the Care and Support they need. 
 Every effort must be made to ensure that our people have access to testing and treatment. Testing is the only means through which they will know their status. 
 Our common purpose as leaders is to ensure that we stop the spread of the disease and that there are no new infections. Our common purpose is shared by people worldwide and should be what we all work towards. 
 Our role as leaders is clear. We have to respond to the crisis that is threatening our communities. Through our involvement and leadership a change in attitude towards the disease is possible. Every effort to change the current behaviour of people must be a priority to all of us. We are an integral part to bringing about change in our communities. As leaders we must stand by and support each other to ensure that we are united in fighting this disease. 
 Let us take our place in the forefront of fighting the disease. Let us show that Good Leaders Lead and that we too form part of the good leaders. 
I thank you.
