The Independent Electoral Commission, Government and the whole of South Africa are committed to the success of the voter registration campaign. An exceptional effort is required for this to succeed. 

The IEC has informed me that it is ready to start the process. 

I wish to congratulate the public servants and other members of the public who have offered their services without extra pay to ensure that this happens. 

This Friday, Saturday and Sunday will be the turn of the people of the Northern Cape, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Northwest and Northern Province. The weekend thereafter, the rest of the Provinces will have their chance. 

This is the beginning of the programme to ensure that all eligible South Africans get the opportunity to register and to vote. 

Depending on the ground covered this time around, there will be yet another chance to register in January and February next year. 

In a project of such a scale, carried out for the first time in our new democracy, it was to be expected that there would be difficulties. But the work that has been done so far and the goodwill that has been shown gives me the confidence that we will succeed. 

We must succeed. And, with your help, it will happen! 

I call on all eligible South Africans to come out and register. Exercise your right to build your future!
