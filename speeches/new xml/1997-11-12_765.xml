This will be the first official visit by the President to Saudi Arabia. 

In addition to a meeting with the Saudi monarch, President Mandela is also expected to meet with Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, other senior members of the royal family and senior Government Ministers. The President will be accompanied by the following cabinet ministers: 

Mr Joe Modise, Minister of Defence 

Mr Penuell Maduna, Minister of Minerals and Energy 

Ms Stella Sigcau, Minister of Public Enterprises 

Mr Aziz Pahad, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs 

The above-mentioned ministers will meet with their counterparts in order to discuss various issues of bilateral concern. 

Relations between South Africa and Saudi Arabia have improved significantly since the establishment of diplomatic relations in October 1994. Bilateral trade has increased fourfold from R251 million in 194 to R1,36 billion in 1996. Saudi Arabia is also becoming increasingly important as a supplier of crude oil to South Africa. 

Relations on a political level have also improved significantly. There is frequent contact on ministerial level as well evidenced by the recent visit to South Africa by Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, the Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence and Aviation of Saudi Arabia, who was also accompanied by several of his Ministers.</body></text></speech>
