Distinguished guests, 

Ladies and gentlemen: 

I stand to thank you most sincerely for the warm welcome you have extended to my delegation and I since we arrived in this historic city of Philadelphia and to thank you for the kind words of both Mayor Rendell and Prof Meyerson. 

In the short time that we have been here, we have begun to appreciate the great importance of this city not only in the context of the history of this country, but also in the universal striving for liberty and the dignity of all human beings. 

We accept that human history is not perfect nor are any social institutions faultless. Therefore the history of this city will itself not be without blemish. 

But we are ready to draw lessons from whatever you consider your failures and derive inspiration from the victories that have been scored here in the struggle to achieve the political, economic, social and spiritual upliftment of the peoples. 

We therefore reach across the oceans to offer you the friendship that you have demonstrated towards our people, and hope you can hear us as we speak from another continent, thanking you for the support you have given to the cause of freedom and justice in our country. 

We salute all of you who have attended this dinner. Your presence this evening has given us the assurance that we shall not be alone as we confront the challenge of transforming South Africa into a truly democratic, peaceful and prosperous country. 

Acting together, we cannot but succeed to make south Africa into a country that will be a fitting partner in the common endeavour of the peoples of this city and country to build a world that is liberated from the scourges of oppression, hunger and destructive wars. 

May we rise and together drink a toast to the friendship of the peoples of our countries. 

To friendship!
