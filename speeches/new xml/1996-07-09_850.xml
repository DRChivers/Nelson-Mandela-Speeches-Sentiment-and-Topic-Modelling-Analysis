On the occasion of the South African National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 30th Anniversary I would like to convey my sincere greetings to all your members. 

I commend all efforts in supporting persons with multiple sclerosis. 

I hope that international research will soon provide some answers to the cause, and, ultimately, to a cure of this disease. 

I wish you all every success in your endeavours. 

Signed by Nelson Mandela 

President Republic of South Africa
