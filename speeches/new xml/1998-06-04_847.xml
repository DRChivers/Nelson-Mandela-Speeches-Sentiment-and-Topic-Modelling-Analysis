Mr Geldenhuys died in the service of his people and his country. He is an example of the many South Africans who have put their lives and families in jeopardy to ensure that we have safety and security as well as respect for our laws. The Ministries of Safety and Security and Transport both at a national and provincial level have assured me that no stone will be left unturned until the perpetrators of this heinous crime are brought to book. 
Tragically, this is yet another indication of the dangerous conditions under which our law enforcement officers work. It calls on us to continue devising ways of improving the security of our personnel while on duty. I am pleased to note that the provincial MEC has already announced some initial measures to improve the situation. 
My sincere condolence to the wife of Warren Geldenhuys and his two children, as well as relatives and friends.
