Dear Hansie, 

Congratulations to you and your team on having completed a successful tour of the subcontinent. 

We watched with admiration as you won the Test series against Pakistan and came through undefeated in the Jubilee Quadrangular Tournament to a stunning victory. 

We would also ask you to extend our congratulations to the Pakistani Cricket Board for having mounted such a successful sporting commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of Pakistan's independence. 

You and the team have done South Africa proud! 

Groete en beste wense!
