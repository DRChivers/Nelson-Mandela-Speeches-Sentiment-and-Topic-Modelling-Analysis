Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 

Buckingham Palace, London 

On my own behalf and on behalf of the Government and people of South Africa, I would like to express profound shock and deepest sympathy at the untimely passing of Diana, Princess of Wales. 

She will be sadly missed as a warm, compassionate and caring person. I vividly recall our meeting when she visited South Africa last year and her burning desire to assist HIV positive children in Africa. Princess Diana had indeed become an Ambassador for victims of landmines, war orphans, the sick and needy throughout the world. 

Your Majesty, Your Majesty's family, His Royal Highness Prince Charles and their sons, Prince William and Prince Harry are in our thoughts and prayers at this sad time. 

Please accept Your Majesty the assurance of my highest consideration.
