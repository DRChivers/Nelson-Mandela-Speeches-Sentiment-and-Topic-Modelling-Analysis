Our struggle for freedom and justice was a collective effort. Mandela Day is no different. It is in your to create a better world for all who live in it. Mandela Day will not be a holiday but a day devoted to service. It is our hope that people will dedicate that time and effort to improve the conditions within their own communities. 

We thank you for participating in Mandela Day.</body></text></speech>
