President Nelson Mandela met a delegation of the Rand Afrikaans University branch of the South African Students Congress at the Union Buildings this morning. The meeting was a follow-up to the visit in June 1997, during which the Rand Afrikaans University management explained their approach towards transformation of the University as well as their attitude to the allegations of the marginalisation of Afrikaans. 

The President pointed out to the students that the new dispensation opened enormous possibilities for our youth, and that they had to exploit them. He outlined the challenges that face the youth of South Africa in relation to the youth of the continent and the world, who have been exposed to better opportunities. 

He emphasised that while all organisations and communities had a right to mass action and protest, the exercise of these rights should not interfere with the rights of others or lead to lawlessness. 

The President expressed unhappiness about the apparent inability of SASCO and other democratic youth organisations, including the ANC Youth League, to mobilise and organise youth from the minority communities. 

He also warned against a growing culture of entitlement among students and communities in general. 

He concluded by pointing out the challenge that is facing SASCO and other democratic youth organisations to inter act with their Afrikaans speaking counterparts. He said he was convinced that an appropriate mobilisation and organisation strategy, would convince the Afrikaans speaking youth that their future was wound together with that of the majority of South Africans.
