I sincerely regret that I am not able to share fully in the evening of celebration and tribute one of the architects of our democracy. 

Colin Eglin has committed a large part of his life serving not only his constituency, but the nation as a whole. And, as those who have had the privilege of working with him will attest, he has done so in ways that have won him universal respect. 

He confirms my profound convictions that there are good men and women in all communities who are committed to building a united South Africa. Men and women who are capable of putting the broader interest of the nation before all else. 

As if his long contribution to our political life was not already enough, he continues to make a valuable input as a Member of Parliament to the national debate on policy without fear or favour. 

I would like to add my voice to those who have gathered to honour a remarkable man, a true son of South Africa, and no stranger to the new patriotism that is healing our land. 

To Colin and Joyce: May you enjoy much happiness together in the days ahead ad be blessed by the peace which freedom has brought us all.
