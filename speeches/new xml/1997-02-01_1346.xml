On the occasion of the 2nd National Congress of the PDS, I convey heartfelt greetings on behalf of the African National Congress. The ANC is acutely aware of how important this congress is to you, organised as it is around the goal of greater unity of progressive forces in Italy. 
In this ever-changing and increasingly interdependent world, many of the challenges confronting Italy also face the countries of the South, not least South Africa. How to ensure that economic growth brings social development? How to combat unemployment and poverty? Effective responses to such challenges require the greatest possible unity of progressive forces. 
More than ever before, we need international solidarity, precisely because South Africans have been the beneficiaries of the solidarity of others, we are committed to international co-operation for peace, prosperity and development. 
I take this opportunity to once more thank the PDS and your predecessor organisation for your selfless support for our struggle against apartheid. Please know that we are grateful to you, and to the people of Italy, for all that you have done - and continue to do - in support of the cause of a non-racial, non-sexist and democratic South Africa. 
Please accept my very good wishes for a successful Congress! 
Nelson R Mandela. 
The People Shall Govern!
