We write to you to express our condolences at the loss that you have suffered. Very often we are called upon to make public pronouncements about such sad events, when in fact it is more appropriate to convey our sentiments privately, since they are sincere and not merely for public consumption. 

Please convey our heartfelt condolences and our good wishes to all of your family. 

Sincerely 

N R MANDELA</body></text></speech>
