I am disappointed that we could not commence with the talks yesterday. This was especially regrettable given the tremendous international expectations and concerns as well as the extensive preparations made by various governments to make these talks possible. I wish to express my appreciation for the patience and understanding shown by President Mobutu Sese Seko, his health condition notwithstanding, and Ambassador Mohamed Sahnoun [unclear] through Deputy President Thabo Mbeki which he thought would make it difficult for him to board the South African vessel. I have subsequently discussed these concerns with both President Sese Seko and Ambassador Sahnoun. [unclear].... 
I am convinced that in President Mobutu Sese Seko and Mr. Laurent Kabila Zaire has sons who have the capacity to be equal in the challenge of taking their country forward and work for a peaceful and prosperous nation. 
May I conclude by acknowledging the constructive and proper by the government of United States of America as well as their decision to send Mr. Bill Richardson as their special envoy. </body></text></speech>
