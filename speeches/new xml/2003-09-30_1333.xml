The Leadership, Governance and Democracy Programme of the Nelson Mandela Foundation comprises of two components: 
*an annual lecture, and 
*a democracy fellowship 
The annual lecture was inaugurated on the 19th of July this year, and has been developed into a public lecture that attracts the best intellectual voices in the world on critical social issues. The purpose of the lecture is for the speaker to raise the social challenges we face in the 21st Century, and to point to possible solutions. We were honoured to have former President William J Clinton to inaugurate the first lecture. 
The second part of the Nelson Mandela Foundation's programme on Leadership, Governance and Democracy is the Nelson Mandela Fellowship. The Fellowship will be for outstanding University Students in the fields of Leadership and Democracy. 
I was pleased to be informed by the Chief Executive of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, Mr John Samuel that SAP has committed to fund the annual lecture and the Fellowship, over the next three years. 
The Nelson Mandela Foundation is also involved in Education-particularly in rural areas, and we also continue to fight the AIDS pandemic. Both these areas impact on developing future leaders in our country and on the African continent. 
A nation's future is only as promising as its next generation of citizens. 
I therefore acknowledge SAP's generous contribution to my Foundation, and assisting us to nurture and produce good leaders, not only in South Africa, but throughout the African continent. 
I thank you.</body></text></speech>
