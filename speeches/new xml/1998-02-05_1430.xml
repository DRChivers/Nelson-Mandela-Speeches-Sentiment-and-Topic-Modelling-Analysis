<speech><date when="1998-02-05">05 February 1998</date><text><term key="1430" /><body>I have been observing with interest the preparations of Bafana Bafana for the defence of the African Nations Cup trophy and your preparations for the 1998 World Cup. 
I am impressed by the fortitude and exemplary manner in which you and your colleagues have handled the changes to the national team. As is the case with all transitions and moments of change, a turbulence will always occur, and its is how we conduct ourselves in such situations that our true character shows. 
I am convinced that Bafana Bafana will do well in Burkina Faso. I believe so because of the tremendous display of the new team and the individual character of the players shown in the past weeks. 
African Nations Cup Finals are the major sport extravaganza on the continent, the ultimate showpiece in African sporting exchange and expression. All participating countries are proud of their teams, and the whole continent is proud of the finals. 
I charge you to go to Burkina Faso to represent your country and your people and of course to pursue the cause of African Unity. On behalf of the millions of South Africans, I wish you success and good luck. We shall be with you throughout the finals.
