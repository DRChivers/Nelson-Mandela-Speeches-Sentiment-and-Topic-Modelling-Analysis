15 September 1994 marks the first Yom Kippur in a democratic South Africa. 

On this solemn day, it is fitting to remember and honour the role played by generations of South Africans of Jewish origin in the struggle to free the country from the bondage of racial domination. 

A democratic South Africa has opened up avenues for all South African cultures and religions to prosper and flourish. 

It is on the occasion of the first anniversary of Yom Kippur in a democratic South Africa that I wish to invite our Jewish compatriots to continue to play the constructive role they have played over the years to make South Africa a prosperous country and a place where all people can live without fear of domination. 

 I wish you well over the fast.
