We are deeply saddened by the news of the death of Hansie Cronj√© in an aircraft accident this afternoon. He was a young South African whom we held in great affection and high esteem. 

His untimely death in an accident is one of those pieces of human tragedy that leaves us shocked and uncomprehending. Here was a young man courageously and with dignity rebuilding his life after the setback he suffered a while ago. The manner in which he was doing that, rebuilding his life and public career, promised to make him once more a role model of how one deals with adversity. At the time of that unfortunate incident in his life we told him that to stumble and fall was not unique in life; it was how one rose and went forward that was significant. And he was giving meaning to that injunction when he was so tragically taken away from us. 

We shall remember him as one of those outstanding young South African leaders that we were blessed with in our national sporting life. He had the potential to become a leader in other areas of our national life, and we are now sadly robbed of those talents and skills he possessed so abundantly. 

We are sure that the entire nation will mourn his death. 

We think particularly of Bertha, his wife; and of his parents Ewie and San-Marie and the rest of the family. They are in our thoughts in these very sad times of loss and bereavement.
