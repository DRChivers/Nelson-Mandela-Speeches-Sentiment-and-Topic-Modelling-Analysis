Today is the birthday of the Prophet Mohammed and our thoughts will be with you and the entire Muslim community, wherever in the world they may be, as you all gather at the various mosques to pay homage to a unique religious leader, whose influence continues to spread to practically every part of the world and to every nation. 

The Muslim community is an important section of our population. Its leaders, too numerous to be mentioned, have for decades been in the forefront of the freedom struggle. 

The combination of the spirit of patriotism and religion has made their contribution to the progress of their country almost peerless. Millions of South Africans of different backgrounds and languages hold the community in high esteem. 

My wife and I send you and the Muslim community our best wishes and congratulations. 

Sincerely 

NELSON MANDELA</body></text></speech>
