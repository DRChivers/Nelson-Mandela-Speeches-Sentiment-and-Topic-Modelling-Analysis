President Nelson Mandela met a delegation of POPCRU at the Union Buildings this morning. 

The delegation gave the President a memorandum which contained their grievances. The President pointed out to the delegation that the Commissioner of Police, George Fivaz had also submitted a memorandum which countered a number of their complaints. 

After a lengthy and frank exchange, it was agreed that a further round of discussions should take place in two weeks time in which the national and provincial leadership of POPCRU would be present. 

The President however wishes to emphasise that his discussions with POPCRU shall not supplant the existing collective bargaining forums. 

President Nelson Mandela indicated that while he appreciated the frustration and difficulties POPCRU was encountering, he did not believe that their current actions would advance their cause and the efforts to bring safety and security to all the citizens of the country.
