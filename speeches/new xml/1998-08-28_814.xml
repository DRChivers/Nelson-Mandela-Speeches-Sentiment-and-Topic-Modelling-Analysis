I noted that this event provides us with a launching pad for a determined national drive for equitable development as we move into the 21st Century. 

Government has since released its proposals for employment creation as contained in the Employment Strategy Framework entitled Creating Jobs, Fighting Poverty. This document has provided the basis for consultation with the social partners in NEDLAC, comprising government, labour, business and community constituencies; and has also been the subject of consultations, comments and contributions from parties not directly represented in NEDLAC. 

The consultations among the social partners have reached an advanced level. A high degree of consensus regarding the objectives and anticipated outcomes of the Jobs Summit has been achieved. In light of this, I am indeed quite happy to take this opportunity to announce that the President's Jobs Summit will be held on Friday, October 30, 1998. 

I am gratified by the high degree of enthusiasm displayed from within government and by social partners and all stakeholders about the Jobs Summit, and I am confident that it will provide us with the opportunity, as a nation, to resolutely commit ourselves to eventually eliminating the scourge of unemployment that continues to eat away at the heart of our society, with so many negative economic, social and political ramifications. It is incumbent upon us as nation, and we owe it to present and future generations, to make the Jobs Summit a success.</body></text></speech>
