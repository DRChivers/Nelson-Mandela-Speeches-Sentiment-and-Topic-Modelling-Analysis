The Courts of Women have developed into an essential component of international media. 
They are special because they raise voices that otherwise would remain buried in the vaults of oppression. The brunt of every calamity, man-imposed or natural, is borne by women. It is therefore most appropriate that you are calling on the women of Cuba to testify the effects of the blockade on the people of Cuba. 
If their testimonies do not realise the objective of the Court to raise the discourse beyond the economic and political to the humanitarian, then I do not know what can. It is on the humanitarian level that hearts are bonded into charity and compassion, and love and peace liberated to work their magic. 
Sanctions are legitimate when used to counteract and destroy tyranny as was the case in South Africa; but they are diabolical when used oppressively against the freedom and human rights of a people. The sanctions against Cuba fall in the later category and they are therefore reprehensible. It is no wonder that the United Nations and the European parliament have condemned them. 
I take this opportunity to reaffirm admiration for the people of Cuba and particularly for my brother, Fidel Castro, for withstanding the tyranny of sanctions with such fortitude for the last 35 years. 
I wish your Court every success.</body></text></speech>
