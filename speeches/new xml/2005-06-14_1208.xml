We have been informed of the decision by President Mbeki about steps taken with regards to deputy president Jacob Zuma. While we are naturally deeply saddened that a person who had made such a major contribution to our liberation and democracy had to come to this point in his life and career. We fully support the president in these difficult times in the life of our organization, nation and government. We are confident that President Mbeki will, as always, lead with wisdom and compassion, guiding our nation through these testing times and holding our organization together. We join President Mbeki in paying tribute to Jacob Zuma for his contribution to our liberation and the building of our democracy. We wish him well as he considers his future and want to reassure him of our continued friendship.
