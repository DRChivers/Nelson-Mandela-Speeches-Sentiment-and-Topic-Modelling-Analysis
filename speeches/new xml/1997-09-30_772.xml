The South African Jewish community has made a significant contribution in all its spheres, including the world of business and the struggle for human rights. It is a community that is amongst the builders of our new society, a community of patriots determined to make South Africa realize her enormous potential. 

May I take this opportunity of wishing the Jewish community good health, joy and prosperity! 

Shanah Tovah!
