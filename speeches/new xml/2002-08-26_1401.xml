What makes the occasion of special meaning to us is not in the first place its reference to ourselves. The major significance is its reference to the South African experience of seeking change through dialogue, negotiations and peaceful settlement. Most of the world expected our country to experience one of the bloodiest racial conflagrations. As a people we confounded the prophets of doom by finding a negotiated settlement amongst erstwhile foes and adversaries. Today we live in a united non-racial and non-sexist democracy where people live and act out their differences within the framework of our constitution. 

We have noted with great appreciation the recent efforts of the Sri Lankan government under the leadership of Honourable Ranil Wickremasinghe to find a peaceful settlement to the long standing conflict in Sri Lanka. The cease-fires declared by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the Government, respectively, augur well for the road ahead. We congratulate both parties and wish them wisdom, endurance and above all the gift of tolerance as they proceed with the peace plan. 

We hope that this play will be successful and that it will in some way serve as an inspiration to the people of Sri Lanka to find lasting peace for themselves and their children. 

My congratulations to the author, the director and the players. May this be a beautiful evening for all. 

I thank you.
