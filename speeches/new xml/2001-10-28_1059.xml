We mourn today with Anton and Huberte Rupert at the tragic loss of their son Anthonij. We know that they hurt and grief greatly and convey to them, and to Johann and Hanlie and the rest of the family, our heartfelt condolences. 
Part of the great legacy that Anton and Huberte left to this society was the example of a closely knit family, caring of each other and sharing in the values that the parents lived out in their private and public lives. For a young man to be cut down in his prime, and in such a tragic manner, hurts all of us. 
We can only trust that Anton and Huberte and the rest of the family may take some solace from the knowledge that so many South Africans share in their grief and hold them in their thoughts. 
On behalf of Graca and myself, my Foundation and the Children's Fund we wish them strength. May you find, even in these difficult times of loss and bereavement, some of that peace that you have worked so hard for in the lives of others.</body></text></speech>
