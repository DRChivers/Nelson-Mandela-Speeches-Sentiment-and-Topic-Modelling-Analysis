Muzi waseStoffelton naseMpendle; 
Baholi beANC kuProvince yaKwaZuluNatal; 
Baholi beANC eNatali eMaphakathi; 
Mphakathi wakuRegion 5; 
Sizwe sikePhunga noMageba, 
Esontweni eledlule bengilana eMnungundlovu ngizomukela ukuhlonishwa ngokunikezwa inkululeko yedolobha. 
Ngenxa yemisebenzi eminingi angiphumelelanga ukuvakashela izindawo ezinye njengalendawo yaseStoffelton naseMpendle. 
Indawo yaseNatali eMaphakathi inendawo ebalulekile enhliziweni yami. Phela indawo lena ka Selby "ukonka wefusi" Msimang omunye wabasunguli beANC; indawo lena kaMoses Mncane Mabhida kaSitimela; indawo lena kaHarry Themba "umuntu omdala" Gwala. 
Ngizobonga abantu baku-Region 5 abavotela i-ANC okhethweni lwasekhaya langomhlaka June 26 kunyaka ofile. 
Nanxa i-ANC ingalunqobanga uketho ku Region 5, kodwa kukule-Region lapho sathola amavoti amaningi kunawo wonke ama-Region noma ezindaweni zasemakhaya. 
Kukule-Region lapho i-ANC yakhombisa khona ukuthi iyinkunzi ikhonyayo emadolobheni nasemakhaya inqobo njena uma abantu bezothola ithuba lokuzikhethela inhlangano abayifunayo nokusebenza kwezipolitiki ngokukhululeka. 
Last week I was here to receive the freedom of Pietermaritzburg. I would have loved to spend more time in this region of Natal Midlands more than I have been able to. 
This region occupies a special place in the struggle for freedom. Great ANC leaders were born here. 
Even although the ANC did not win Region 5 in the last local elections, it is from here that most of the ANC's rural vote came. Your vote proved that the ANC can lead both in town and the countryside if there is free political activity and freedom of choice. 
It is the task of the ANC, and of course that of the government, to ensure that there is free political activity for all political parties throughout KwaZulu/Natal and indeed throughout South Africa. 
We do not want free political activity just for the ANC but for all political parties and groups. 
Freedom of expression and free political activity are democratic principles enshrined in our constitution. The state and our people must protect and uphold those principles. The violation of those principles is the violation of the constitution itself. 
I am aware that there are areas which are "no-go areas" to the ANC, the IFP or other parties in this province. 
We cannot boast of freedom when some of our people cannot freely chose a political party. There can be no freedom where there is fear. There can be no democracy where there is no political choice. 
Thina njengamashoshozela eANC sinomsebenzi omkhulu emahlombe ethu. 
Kufanele siqiniseke ukuthi siyaziqeda lezindawo ezingo-alubhadwa. 
Kusemahlombe ethu ukuqiniseka ukuthi kunokukhululeka kwazepolitiki kuwo wonke amaqembu ezepolitiki nakubantu nje. 
Ngeke sakhuluma ngenkululeko uma kesenokusaba kubantu bakithi ukuba baveze imibono yabo ngokukhululeka, bakhethe amaqembu ezepolitiki ngokungesabi. 
Aziphele izindawo okuthiwa azibhadwa kwamanye amaqembu noma ngabe zisemadolobheni, emakhaya ezindaweni zamakhosi noma emapulazini amaBhunu. Asibe nenkululeko yezepolitiki kuyo yonke indawo! 
Isimo sezokuphepha lapha KwaZulu/Natali ikakulukhazi lapha eMgungundlovu namaphethelo asikagculisi. 
Ngisho amaphoyisa uqobo asabulawa njengoba kwenzeka khona lapha eMpendle naseRichmond ngonyaka owedlule. Masiphume umkhankaso sivikele amaphoyisa kulezigebengu! Masiyeke ukufukamela izigebengu. 
Emasontweni amabili edlule ngoLwesine usihialo weANC Stoffelton Branch uComrade Bhekani Ngubo kanye nendodana yakhe uAndile behlaselwa badutshulwa ngezibhamu emini. Ngenhlanhla nanxa balimala kodwa basaphila. Phepha Ngxabi! 
These criminals are using the climate of political conflict to carry out their dirty work against our communities and against both the ANC and IFP themselves. They exploit even the smallest sign of conflict in a desperate attempt to reverse the clock of history. 
Any member of the ANC who is still involved in political violence is not a genuine member of the ANC. Political violence against any section of our people has never been our policy. 
I believe the leadership of the IFP when it says it is embracing peace amongst our people. I believe that they are genuine. 
Therefore anyone within these organisations who is still engaged in violence is violating the very policies of both the ANC and the IFP. They are enemies of both organisations. 
The hills and the valleys of Impendle and Stoffelton have been witness to the slaughter of our people in the past fifteen years. 
Many of our dear ones lie buried in the wombs of these hills and valleys. 
If we do not seize this moment to reach out to each other, our patriots shall have died in vain. 
If we do not unite for peace and development then future generations will hold us responsible for the continued suffering and deprivation of our people. 
Let us turn these hills and valleys into mountains of peace. Let us turn them into symbols of hope. 
Kusasa i-ANC kulesifundazwe izobe inomhlangano eThekwini okuzobe kukhulunywa ngentuthuko ezindaweni zasemakhaya. 
Ubalulekile loyomhlangano ngoba izindawo zakithi ezisemakhaya amaBhunu aqiniseka ukuthi azithuthuki. 
Kubalulekile ukuthi izithunywa ezivela kumagatsha eANC asezindaweni zasemakhaya abambe iqhaza elibalulekile kulomhlangano. 
Loyomhlangano kufanele uphume nesinqumo nezindlela zokwenza ngcono izimpilo zabantu bakithi emakhaya. 
Abantu bakithi kulezindawo badinga amanzi ompompi ahlanzekile, imigwaqo elungisiwe, imitholampilo, izibhedlela, izikole. 
Lomhlangano wakusasa kufanele uphume nesincomo seANC ukuthi abantu bakithi emakhaya kufanele ukuba bazibuse kanjani ngaphandle kokuxabana namakhosi. 
Kuye kumangalise uma abanye abaholi bezepolitiki bethi lohulumeni wentando yeningi awenzi lutho ukuthuthukisa iziimpilo zabantu. 
Kufanele sibabuze labo baholi ukuthi bona ngesikathi bephethe iminyaka eminingi kangaka babenzelani abantu bakithi. 
Umholi ohlala egxeka abanye abaholi ebe yens engaqhamukhi nacebo lokuxazulula izinkinga akusimhloll walutho. 
Okubalulekile ukuthi abantu bakithi abasemakhaya nabo bayilwela lenkululeko. Nabo banelungelo lokuzuza ezithelweni zenkululeko. Izinga lokuphila labÂ° alingabi ngaphansi kwalelo labantu basemadolobheni. 
Kufanele bathole umhlaba wokulima bondle imindeni yabo bafuye nezinkomo. 
Kufanele bathole wonke amathhuba wokuzithuthukisa atholwa yibo bonke abantu abanyama noma abamhlophe basemadolobheni. 
KumaKhansela eANC ngithi kuwo: 
Maningakhohlwa ukuthi nakhethwa abantu ngaphansi kwegama IeANC. 
Maningakhohlwa abantu abanikhetha ngoba benithemba. 
Kufanele njalo nimele izidingo zabantu kuRegional Council. 
Hlalani njalo nixhumene nabantu bakule region. Xoxisanani nabo ngezimfuno nangezifiso zabo. 
Nanxa nibancane ngenani kuleRegional Council, kodwa nibaningi ngokwengqondo nasekwazini izidingo zabantu ngoba ningamadodana namadodakazi abantu bakule-region. Ningamalungu enhlangano yabantu - uKhongolose kaMafukuzela neNkosi uLuthuli. 
Abaholi beANC kuwo wonke amazinga kufanele bazithobe babenenhionipho kubantu bakithi. 
Asibona obasi babantu kodwa siyizisebenzi zabo. Labo baholi abazibiza ngokuthi banabalandeli babo hayi benhlangano abakayazi i-ANC. 
Ngisho mina nginuMongameli weANC anginabo abalandeli bami, abalandeli beANC. 
In our first three years of freedom the lives of our people have begun to change. The programmes of the ANC-led government are making a difference to communities across the country. 
These things may not have reached all of you yet, but the foundation has been laid. 
We all know that undoing the legacy of apartheid will take time. 
Though we can be proud of what we have achieved, there are still formidable challenges ahead of us. 
We will be more than equal to these challenges if we maintain unity among our ranks and build the ANC organisation at grassroot levels. 
We must sharpen our organisational strength at all levels and use that strength to improve the lives of our people where they live. 
The foundation for a better life has been laid. Now the call upon us all is: Forward ever!
