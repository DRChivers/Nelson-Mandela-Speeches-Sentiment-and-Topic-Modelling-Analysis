President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President, FW de Klerk, leader of the National Party, wish to announce with deep regret that Mr Gert Myburgh, Deputy Minister of Justice in the Government of National Unity, suddenly passed away this afternoon, 11 March 1996. 

Immediate reports indicated that he died of a heart attack. Further details will be announced after consultations with medical personnel. 

The President, his two Deputy Presidents and the government as a whole wish to extend their condolences to Mr Myburgh's widow, his family and next of kin. His sudden and tragic departure has robbed the Government and the people of South Africa, of a valued public servant.
