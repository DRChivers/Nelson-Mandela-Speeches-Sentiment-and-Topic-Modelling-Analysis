Congratulations on the celebration of your 75th birthday. We wish you many more healthy and happy years. 

While serving in our Cabinet we often referred to you as the "Minister of all portfolios". Although we did so in a humorous way, there was truth to it. Few people have the knowledge and experience to compare with you and you have become an expert on so many subjects that your wealth of knowledge is an asset to our movement and our country. Your 75th birthday is then also an appropriate and welcome opportunity to thank you for your friendship over the years. The sacrifices you have made and the role that you played will remain in our history books forever. We thank you and we hope that you will not only celebrate your birthday but also your outstanding achievements. 

Once again, please accept our warm wishes and congratulations for your birthday. 

Sincerely 

Madiba</body></text></speech>
